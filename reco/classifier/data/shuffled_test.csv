G.R. Nos. L-27680-81,Murder,2,the facts established conclusively by the evidence are the following at about 1200 oclock noon on december 31 1965 while prosecution witness epifanio cabe was walking along one of the streets of barrio dapdap municipality of las navas north samar and arrived in front of the house of one pablo jazmines he saw appellant holding the now deceased carlos tapong by the neck as the two were apparently wrestling with each other carlito pajenado appellants cousin intervened and the two pajenados were able to throw tapong to the ground carlito pajenado held tapong by the shoulder and pinned him down to the ground while appellant held him by one leg as they thus held carlos tapong helpless appellant drew his gun and fired at him thereupon carlito pajenado stood up and ran away while appellant remained at the scene of the crime with his drawn gun until a policeman another pajenado (ernesto) arrived and took the firearm from him carlos tapong mortally wounded was thereafter carried home by his father and other relatives another prosecution witness pelagia tapong testified that at noon on the day in question while she was at the window of the house of her elder brother angel along the street where the incident took place she saw appellant standing on the street; that when carlos tapong appeared appellant immediately met him and held him by the neck; that thereafter carlito pajenado intervened and with his help appellant was able to fell carlos to the ground it is not denied that carlos tapong died as a result of the gunshot wound inflicted upon him on that occasion testifying on the nature thereof dr angel tan municipal health officer of las navas said that he conducted a post mortem examination of the cadaver on january 1 1966 and found that the deceased sustained three gunshot wounds which in his opinion were caused by a single shot from a 45 caliber pistol the wounds are described by him in his autopsy report exhibits a a1 and a2 as follows gun shot wound with entrance at the posteromedial portion of the distal third of the thigh making an exit at its upper promixmal third in the anterolateral margin making another entrance at the right hypogastric region penetrating the abdominal cavity perforating the intestines penetrating the left dome of the diaphragm to enter the left thoracic cavity dr tan also testified that considering the presence of powder burns in the body of the deceased he must have been shot at a distance of less than one meter and that the cause of his death was shock due to external and internal hemorrhage the testimony of prosecution witness pelagia tapong clearly shows that for sometime before the incident appellant had been waiting for carlos tapong to appear and that as soon as the latter showed up and arrived in front of the house of pablo jazmines appellant met him and held him by the neck; that thereafter his cousin carlito helped him throw their victim to the ground this we believe is sufficient evidence of premeditation 
G.R. No. L-23113,Murder,2,it is not disputed that on july 28 1960 at about 730 pm the body of pastor ladesa was found in a coffee grove about 200 to 300 meters from his house in balabag astorga municipality of sta cruz davao with several incise wounds on the head which must have caused his death at about 200 pm due to cerebral concussion and cerebral hemorrhage as well as internal and external hemorrhage the only question for determination in this case is who killed him appellant sixto comigjod is married to juliana calungsod daughter of ana albano the latter is in turn ladesas commonlaw wife hence the witnesses herein refer to ladesa as appellants fatherinlaw early in the morning july 29 1960 juliana informed vicebarrio lieutenant victorino andres that ladesas killer is her husband appellant herein soon thereafter that same morning andres transmitted the information to policemen frank bumpus and modesto alama who had come to investigate the occurrence thereafter the policemen proceeded to the scene of the occurrence where appellant was bumpus asked him whether it was he who killed ladesa but appellant did not reply when policeman alama confronted him with the report given by his wife to andres appellant admitted being the killer queried about the instrument used to commit the offense comigjod answered that it was a bolo he had in his house forthwith the policemen accompanied him thereto where comigjod turned over to them the bolo exhibit d which was still stained with blood brought to the police station appellant was further investigated by bumpus to whom the former confessed that he had killed ladesa because he had been too harsh at him thereupon bumpus typewrote the statement exhibit e which appellant thumbmarked and swore to on july 30 1960 before the justice of the peace of sta cruz artemio cometa appellant testified that on july 28 1960 he was with his wife in the house of the aforementioned victorino andres from 1100 am to 400 pm; that when the policemen asked him at the scene of the occurrence why he had killed ladesa he (appellant) denied having done so; that the bolo exhibit d was taken from his house by the policemen not delivered by him to them; that he thumbmarked the statement exhibit e without knowing its contents because the policemen assured him that after affixing his thumbmark thereon they would release him; and that instead however they took him back to his cell where later in the evening they boxed him on the stomach and kicked him on the forehead needless to say the policemen denied having used the alleged duress indeed the same was obviously unnecessary because it was resorted to according to appellant after he had thumbmarked the statement exhibit e moreover the justice of the peace affirmed positively that he had caused the contents of the statement to be translated in his presence to appellant herein into the visayan dialect; that he checked whether the translation was accurate or not; that he (cometa) even inquired from appellant whether the translation into english contained in the statement was likewise accurate; and that appellant answered in the affirmative again nobody ever saw any external sign of appellants alleged maltreatment or was even informed by him about it it seems only too obvious that appellants testimony cannot prevail over that of the justice of the peace upon the other hand appellants alibi was contradicted by victorino andres who declared that appellant went to his (andres) house at 400 pm and was not accordingly there at 200 pm when the crime charged was committed what is more appellant did not introduce the testimony of his wife who according to the theory of the defense was with him when they allegedly went to said house at 1100 am and stayed there continuously up to 400 pm and the reason seems obvious for had she testified for the defense she would have been crossexamined on the fact that it was she who revealed to andres early in the morning on july 29 1960 that the murderer was her husband this was impliedly confirmed by appellant himself he having admitted on the witness stand that while at the scene of the occurrence the policemen asked him why he had killed ladesa it will be recalled in this connection that before proceeding to said place the peace officers had passed by the house of andres who conveyed to them the information given to him by appellants wife 
G.R.

which would have caused their deaths; thus with respect to the lattermentioned injured victims the accused had performed all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime also of murder as a consequence but which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of some causes independent of the will of the accused that is due to the timely and able medical assistance rendered to said pfc camelo algaba pfc rogelio aburido sgt epifanio mercado and pat nestor era which prevented their death contrary to law the prosecution presented the following as witnesses pfc camilo algaba dr ramon nemenzo p/lt epifanio mercado jocelyn chan michael valencia and dr tranquilino carmona while the defense relied on the testimonies of lemy cahayagan and the accused gerardo cogonon the prosecutors

being heldhowever according to pfc camelo algabathey still failed to find the armed group at the dance hall so the team proceeded to barangay castellano where they once more failed to encounter any armed group thus they went back to sitio daang lungsod by then it was already 1000 oclock in the eveningt/sgt tucaling was driving the patrol vehicle with pat oebanda beside him riding in the back on the left side were pfc aburido and pat era with the former seated behind t/sgt tucaling at the right side of the vehicle were pat sumili (who was seated behind pat oebando) pfc algaba and p/sgt mercado while negotiating a hilly curve in sitio daang lungsod their vehicle was suddenly hit just below the windshield by a rifle grenade the explosion was swiftly followed by a volley of gunshots coming from both sides of the road the policemen returned fire as the rifle grenade hit the vehicle and exploded t/sgt tucaling lost control of the same causing it to swerve to the left side of the road hitting an embankment the vehicle stopped parallel to the road its headlights pointed in the direction of the attackers despite the exchange of gunshots the vehicles headlights remained undamaged and illuminated the ambushers thereby enabling the victims to identify them during the firefight p/sgt mercado recognized appellant nonoy cogonon whom he had known prior to the incident as a member of the civilian home defense force (chdf) he was on the left side of the road in fatigue uniform and armed with an m16 rifle mercado likewise saw ""alias goliath"" (rodrigo romeo) guillermo empenado and ""alias agui"" (violeto tormis) mercados identification of the assailants was corroborated by pfc algabawhen the smoke of battle (which lasted 15 minutes) cleared t/sgt tucaling pat oebanda and pat sumili were found dead on the spotwhile pfc algaba p/sgt mercado pfc aburido and pat era sustained various injuriesthe latter casualties were brought to the san carlos planters and laborers hospital for treatmentthe version of the defense for his part appellant then 23 years old interposed denial and alibi according to him he grew up in barangay lagaan calatrava negros occidental after two of his brothers were killed he relocated to barangay cruz and became a chdf member under the leadership of marcial mahilum he knew other chdf members like junior delima guillermo empenado and buenaventura entienza he was also familiar with members of the police force of calatrava like t/sgt tucaling and p/sgt mercado because he used to hang out at the municipal hall as a chdf member he was issued an m16 armalite which he claimed to have surrendered to emiliano anthony when he ""rested"" after the death of their leader marcial mahilum he also claimed that inasmuch as he did not formally resign from the chdf he could obtain a firearm anytimeappellant acquired a farm in barangay cruz which measured more than a hectare it was cultivated by lemy cahayagan whose house was about two (2) kilometers from his own place in the afternoon of that fateful day october 14 1985 he was allegedly in cahayagans house attending a thanksgiving party he arrived there at 500 oclock in the afternoon and had dinner at 900 oclock in the evening from then on until 1200 oclock midnight he drank tuba with lemy and camilo cahayagan eusebio caramihan carlos and lito lumanog he did not leave the cahayagan residence until 700 oclock in the morning of the following daylemy cahayagan corroborated appellants testimony adding that barangay cruz is about twenty (20) kilometers from barangay lemery and could not be reached via the national highwaythe issues as stated above the trial court convicted appellant of the crimes charged not satisfied with the decision cogonon interposed the present appeal assigning a single error the trial court erred in convicting accusedappellant gerardo cogonon of the crimes charged despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt appellant contendsthat his conviction was based on the trial courts presumption that the crime was perpetrated by the chdf of which he was a member citing as basis for his contention the following portion of the questioned decision the court perceives this [recall of firearms by the police] to be the seed of hatred which germinated in the minds of the chdf members whose guns capt ponteras had ordered withdrawn and culminated in the ambush slaying of the seven policemen this coming straight from the horses mouth as testified to by cogonon himselfthe trial court in fact added that ""the ponteras order had generated an undercurrent of resentment on the part of the chdfs which motivated them to perpetrate this dastardly slaughter""according to cogonon he never testified to that effect he believes that the portion of his testimony which could have been made the basis for the trial courts conclusion is the following q it appears from the record that by the way would you admit and agree with me that some members of the chdf were disgusted or disheartened because of that order requiring them to surrender the firearms considering that they were deprived of their protection a i do not know what they felt as i already returned minethus relying on gaerlan vs court of appealsappellant argues that his conviction cannot be predicated on a presumption or speculation but on clear and positive evidence moreover while his defense is alibi it should not be totally disregarded the possibility exists that taken in the light of all the evidence on record his alibi may suffice to acquit him since every circumstance must be considered in favor of the presumption of innocence "

nonetheless tell a story of selfdefense appellant gaspar admitted killing the victims but in selfdefense he claimed that after felix salacut found his bolo which he was looking for rogelio remarked ""you hack him"" at that instance felix faced appellant gaspar with a raised bolo and advanced towards him poised to strike him with the bolo appellant gaspar moved back picked up a stone and threw it at felix hitting the latter on the right side of his forehead felix fell to the ground losing hold of his bolo appellant gaspar then picked the bolo up and thrust it on the right side of felixs neck

september 16 1993 he went to sleep he was awakened by his mother at about 10 oclock telling him that there was an ongoing quarrel downstairs among appellant gaspar and romeo felix and rogelio so appellant ernesto took his mother out of the house and went to the safety of the house of his uncle gaudioso sinda he stayed there until the following morning while there is no evidence of a previous agreement between the appellants to kill the victims their simultaneous acts in stoning the victims indubitably show unity of purpose and intent to harm the victims these circumstances were positively

G.R. No. L-24781,Murder,2,"the trial court found the facts as follows ""on the evening of march 30 1961 at about 700 oclock bienvenido laxamana was inside a store of one honoria atienza next to his house on the same side of the street in the poblacion of bamban tarlac he was then sitting and eating peanuts while in that position mario salonga alias manding who is still at large and the accused carlos fernando alias bob without any warning suddenly and unexpectedly fired shots with their 45 caliber pistols at laxamana the duo then departed leaving their victim sprawled outside the store salonga and fernando were members of the hukbalahap organization before going to bamban tarlac on the evening of the incident they were somewhere within the jurisdiction of angeles city where they received instruction from one of their commanders francisco ronquillo alias commander manly to liquidate laxamana the motive was that the latter while an officer of the civilian guards had ordered the killing of a relative of commander ""manly"" and the beating up of the father of salonga fernando and salonga went to bamban from angeles city by walking all along between sugar cane field after the killing of laxamana they also decamped together the same route the victim bienvenido laxamana was married to remedios l laxamana two daughters were born out of their wedlock the elder of whom is 13 years old before his death laxamana was a member of the central azucareras de tarlac planters association of that province when his brotherinlaw the late sinforoso lomboy was the municipal mayor of bamban sometime in 1950 he became a member of the civilian guards or the civilian commando unit (ccu) in that town with the rank of captain that evening of march 30 1961 mrs laxamana came from the catholic church of bamban with her elder daughter bernadette while on her way home and when the distance from her house was about thirty meters she heard the firing of shots she took cover in one stores; and after the firing had ceased she went out and hurriedly proceeded to her home in front of the store of honoria atienza she saw her husband sprawled on the ground full of blood she was not able to come close to him because somebody held her back a jeep arrived where her husband was placed but not long thereafter he was brought back already dead dr honorato navarro municipal health officer of bamban tarlac made the autopsy of the victims cadaver or the same night of the murder and per his necropsy reportthe victim cited of ""hemorrhage massive secondary to gunshot wounds multiple (23) in neck chest and back lumbar region and upper and lower extremities"" many of which were mortal wounds hitting vital organs in the neck such as the carotid artery and the vagus nerve both lungs and the liver kidneys and intestines in the lumber region the trial court rejected the accuseds testimony at the trial that he did not fire any shot at the victim but merely stood guard outside the store and that his role after salonga had ceased firing at the victim was to fire three shots in the air as a signal for them to depart thus ""(t)he court entertains a very serious doubt on the veracity of the abovementioned statement of the accused because the same is contrary to what he stated when he was first investigated by the pc after his apprehension portion of his written statement (exh f1) reads as follows 12 t — natupad ba naman ninyo ang iniutos ni comdr francisco ronquillo na patayin si bienvenido laxamana s — opo napatay namin sa pamamagitan ng pagbaril sa kanya nuong gabing iyon ng ika30 ng marzo 1961 13 t — anong clase ng baril ang inyong ginamit sa pagpatay kay laxamana s — pareho po kaming gumamit ng pistola calibre 45 si mario salonga alias manding na aking kasama ay nakapagpaputok ng humigit kumulang sa labingdalawa at ako naman ay tatlong putok 14 t — sinabi mong natupad ninyo ang utos ni comdr francisco ronquillo alias commander manly na patayin si bienvenido laxamana natatandaan mo ba kung saan lugar ninyo binaril at pinatay ang taong naturan s — duon po sa loob ng isang tindahan sa poblacion bamban tarlac na ang mayari sa naturang tindahan ay hindi ko kilala the answer of the accused to the abovequoted question no 13 to the effect that he and salonga both used 45 caliber pistols in killing laxamana with salonga firing twelve shots and he three shots conveys no other idea than that the three shots he fired were directed at the victim and not upwards into the air the court is inclined to believe that this statement is the one in keeping with the truth taking into consideration the determination of the accused to participate in the killing of laxamana and the number of gunshot wounds found on the latters body at any rate the trial court further held there was no doubt as to the existence of conspiracy between the accused and salonga as the accused actively participated in the criminal design of salonga and acted in concert with him granting arguendo that the accused merely stood guard for salonga and that salonga alone inflicted the 23 gunshot wounds on the victim the trial court likewise rejected the accuseds contention that he should be punished only for the crime of rebellion as the murder was in pursuance of the huks rebellion movement since the motive for the killing of the victim was personal to avenge the alleged killing of a relative of commander manly and the alleged maltreatment of the father of salonga supposedly ordered by the victim the trial court further pointed out that while the victim had been an officer of the civilian guards in bamban that was more than ten years ago in 1950 and the victim was an ordinary civilian when he was shot in cold blood "
G.R. No. L-27610,Murder,2,"the victims in this case jaime amilagan and his brother ernesto amilagan had filed the application for pasturelease agreement no 22449 covering a public land of about 200 hectares in the sitio of daga municipality of coner province of apayao which rogelio t cardenas the acting officerincharge of the bureau of lands had recommended for approval defendants teodorico empe? and his wife cecilia archeta as well as their sons aurelio and apolonio empe? and their soninlaw jesufin (peping) verdadero in turn held a small parcel of land which the amilagans claim to be within the area covered by their aforementioned application it appears that sometime before december 6 1961 teodorico empe? had made a kaingin in said parcel of land in view of which he was on december 6 1961 accused of illegal ""kaingin"" upon the recommendation of the aforementioned rogelio t cardenas the empe?s in turn filed a complaint against the amilagans for the destruction of the corn of the former by the cows of the latter apparently these incidents had induced the empe?s to enclose the area held by them with a barbed wire fence which was broken however by the amilagan brothers on june 11 or 12 1965 in order that their cows could pass through and go to the place where they were scheduled to be branded on june 13 1965 on june 12 1965 at 3 pm as jaime and ernesto amilagan together with pascual contreras aurelio balunsat deogracias de leon federico amilagan and juanita catnae were walking singlefile along a trail passing through a hilly place covered thickly by tall grass coming from the corral of said brothers defendant cecilia archeta stopped them and asked ernesto amilagan why he had destroyed said fence ernesto answered that he had done so to let his cows pass in going to the branding place the next day cecilia then remarked in a loud voice ""you are very tough"" whereupon aurelio empe? emerged from the west side of the trail and forthwith gave jaime amilagan a bolo slash on the left side and forth of the head almost at the same time teodorico empe? came out of the tall grasses and immediately swung his bolo at ernesto amilagan who in his attempt to evade the blow tripped over a muddy hole and fell down on his face thereupon aurelio hacked him on the right side of the head similarly teodorico swung his bolo at ernesto whereas cecilia clubbed him on the back and with a bolo slash wounded two (2) of his fingers at this juncture jesufin verdadero and apolonio empe? appeared from different directions and swung their respective bolos at ernesto whom jesufin wounded on the upper part of the breast near the thorax and apolonio on the left leg moreover teodorico gave ernesto another bolo slash on the left forearm the amilagan brothers died on the spot due to hemorrhage the defense maintains that the injuries sustained by both had been inflicted by aurelio empe? singlehandedly and acting in selfdefense it tried to prove that as aurelio was fetching one of his carabaos which was tied to a tree in the afternoon of the occurrence jaime amilagan came and immediately wounded him with a bolo slash in his left forearm; that thereupon he (aurelio) drew out his bolo and swung it at jaimes head that ernesto amilagan then approached and attacked him with his (ernestos) bolo; that he (aurelio) evaded the bolo slashes given by ernesto and reciprocated the same with his (aurelios) own bolo thereby inflicting several wounds upon ernesto; and that teodorico empe? his wife cecilia and their soninlaw jesufin verdadero were then working on the concession of one pacis who was jesufins landlord about two (2) hours walk from the scene of the occurrence furthermore apolonio empe? — then below sixteen (16) years of age — testified that after taking his meal on june 12 1965 he went in search of one of his carabaos which he was unable to locate because at about 3 pm sgt taliping came and invited him to go back to his house; that on the way thereto they met aurelio empe? who was wounded and drenched in blood and explained that he had been wounded by jaime amilagan; and that thereupon taliping brought him and aurelio to their hut near which they found the dead bodies of two (2) persons in this connection it should be noted that the theory of the defense is based mainly upon the testimony of the defendants whereas the version of the prosecution is supported by the testimony of pascual contreras and deogracias de leon who were with the amilagan brothers at the time of the occurrence and were corroborated by sgt taliping after analyzing the evidence his honor the trial judge in a carefully written decision accepted the version of the prosecution and found that of the defense unworthy of credence indeed the defense maintains that the occurrence was triggered by jaime amilagan who had allegedly attacked aurelio empe? and wounded him on the left arm with a bolo sgt taliping positively testified however that when he met aurelio empe? that afternoon immediately after the occurrence he did not have any injury in the body then also sgt taliping testified that upon being informed by aurelio balunsat that there had been some killings in the ranch of the amilagans he (taliping) proceeded thereto immediately; that on the way he met apolonio empe? whose clothes were stained with blood; that apolonio was moreover carrying a bloodstained bolo; that upon being asked to explain his condition apolonio replied that he his father teodorico his mother cecilia his brother aurelio and his brotherinlaw jesufin verdadero had killed jaime amilagan and ernesto amilagan besides aurelio admitted that the amilagans had no possible reason to try to kill him on the other hand there is ample evidence to the feel that the defendants harbored illfeelings towards the amilagan brothers not only because the latter had succeeded in securing a favorable indorsement of their application for a pasturelease agreement covering an expensive area which included the land held and cultivated by the empe?s but also because the amilagans had thrown down their (empe?s) fence apart from seeking their prosecution for illegal ""kaingin"" the theory of the defense is further weakened by the circumstance that the testimony of the defendants is inherently incredible for apolonio empe? would have us believe that he did not even know the names of the two (2) dead persons he found at the scene of the occurrence and that he had never seen them before although they were in fact neighbors "

during the shooting incident paule denied the charge he revealed that he was a former commander of the new peoples army in pampanga who quilt in 1989 to start a new life he alleged that he visited his

market testified in favor of paule she declared that shortly after the incident the authorities arrived at the scene of the crime and took the personal belongings of tubongbanua including the latters

G.R. No. L-22087,Murder,2,"the prosecution relying mainly on the testimonies of two eyewitnesses — vidal masong and ahenor pagasihan and that of dr megdonio bacal attending physician established the following at about 300 pm on august 1 1959 in barrio taytay municipality of el salvador misamis oriental appellant labis with a bolo chased the deceased clarito fabria near the national highway when the latter happened to pass by a coconut tree appellant cabiles who was standing there grabbed him and locked his arms around the shoulders of clarito fabria with cabiles chest pressing against the right shoulder of clarito this enabled labis to overtake clarito fabria and thereupon the former stabbed the latter with the bolo at his back appellant cabiles then released the deceased who badly wounded tried to run further towards his fathers house later clarito fabria was brought for treatment to the provincial hospital at cagayan de oro city where he died two hours later the attending physician dr bacal found an opening stab wound about three inches long at the back lumbar region middle which deviated laterally to the left and causing an exit wound of one inch in front at the left iliac region (lower abdomen)dr bacal also testified that the two wounds could have been caused by a bolo and that the decedents death was due to profuse internal hemorrhage resulting from multiple perforation of the sigmoid and mysentery of the intestine organs usually found on the left of the abdominal cavity the defense narrated the events differently according to appellants labis and cabiles and three of their alleged eyewitness what transpired was this on the morning of august 1 1959 labis and cabiles with several of their barriomates attended a community group work locally known as ""pahina"" at the public school compound about noontime they all proceeded to the wedding party at pedro estradas house where the deceased and the latters brotherinlaw raul espejon were also present lunch over the group left the place together at the invitation of the decedent and espejon on the way home the two walked ahead while labis cabiles and the rest followed about 20 meters behind as the decedent fabria and espejon neared the national highway the latter stopped near a coconut tree as appellant labis approached espejon confronted him with a bolo asking whether he had a grudge against clarito fabria labis answered that they ought not fight as they were brothers sensing trouble francisco labis a third degree cousin of mauricio labis intervened and advised the two not to fight raul espejon then repaired towards the nearby house of dionisio gaid and labis with the others went their way at this moment clarito fabria brandishing a bolo came running towards them and asked labis of the latter had any grudges against him labis retreated with upraised hands and endeavoured to pacify the deceased by calling him brother and pleading that they should not fight clarito answered by slashing his bolo at labis who in trying to parry the blow was wounded on his left wrist labis retreated further but raul espejon reappeared on the scene and bolo labis at the nape wounding him also appellant labis then turned to face espejon when clarito fabria hurled his bolo at him with the handleend thereof hitting labis on the breast the decedent now bent down to pick up the bolo which fell by labis left side but the latter immediately warded off claritos hands this caused the decedent to turn halfway to his right exposing his left flank to labis instantly labis drew his own bolo from the waist and thrust it at the decedents back at the left side of the lumbar region on the level of the pelvis clarito fabria then ran away wounded towards dionisio gaids house a few moments later policeman maximo gallego who had fired several shots upwards while still at a distance arrived at the scene of the incident and labis surrendered to him the bolo (exh c also marked as exh 12) he used in stabbing clarito fabria and also the bolo (exh 14) which the latter allegedly hurled at him policeman gallego placed labis and cabiles under custody and then went after raul espejon in the house of hugo fabria and got rauls bolo still later gregorio salas the chief of police of el salvador arrived and brought appellants labis and cabiles to the municipal building for investigation appellant cabiles denied having held the decedent clarito fabria as testified to by the prosecution witnesses he claimed that when the deceased confronted labis with a drawn bolo he (cabiles) and francisco labis stood between the protagonists and tried to pacify them and prevent a fight however when clarito fabria threw his bolo at labis cabiles retreated about four meters away since he was afraid that clarito carried a dagger also which he might use at first blush the theory advanced by the defense would seem foolproof but a closer examination of the same reveals weaknesses that cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny the defense witnesses either close friends or relatives of the accused gave evidently wellrehearsed testimonies likely to mislead the gullible and unsuspecting person however a careful evaluation of their version of the incident would show its inconsistency with the natural course of events and human conduct for instance their claim that the accused mauricio labis delivered the fatal blow at the back of clarito labis while they were embracing each other and as the latter was about to pick up his bolo from the ground is not borne out by the position and direction of the wounds of said victim their observations do not also coincide because one declared that mauricio labis pushed aside clarito fabria instead of embraced him as two others testified some even asserted that clarito fabria was hit on the left side of his back which is not true the finding of dr megdonio bacal the examining physician at the provincial hospital of misamis oriental located the entrance wound of about 3 inches in length at the back of clarito fabria across the lower portion of his spinal column and the injury deflected laterally towards his left front side below the waistline causing an exit wound of about an inch in length (exhs b"" "
G.R. No. L-28163,Homicide,1,"the evidence for the prosecution showed the following sayawon lumigaw and his wife dagaw sumingit lived in barrio tuno tudela misamis occidental where they owned lands planted to abaca coconut corn and rice the barrio of tuno is remote and mountainous and inhabited mostly by a cultural minority known as ""subanos"" sayawons house which was built atop a hill had an attic; there according to prosecution witness biato mapon widowed soninlaw of sayawon the couple kept two (2) jars of money in coins amounting to p200000; biato had carried these jars himself when they transferred from the old house (tsn 13 june 1967 page 10) dana the wife of biato and amping a son of sayawon also lived in the same dwelling along a trail leading to sayawons house is the house of bastiana soling prosecution witness anselmo gumalay testified that he was there on 25 september 1965 at around 400 oclock in the afternoon (to judge from the position of the sun) and while grinding corn by the doorway he saw three (3) persons pass by; he recognized one of them to be the accused teofilo gande the witness did not recognize the other two because their hats were titled covering their eyes (tsn 13 june 1967 pages 1213) the principal witness of the prosecution teofilo sandalan who did not know his age was estimated to be 14 years old at the time he testified in 1967 this witness declared that he and his uncle sayawon lumigaw went to the ""parian"" on 25 september 1965; sayawon won a cock there and on their way home sayawon invited teofilo to drop by his house as he wanted to give him half of the cock they arrived at sayawons house at about 500 oclock in the afternoon reckoned by the position of the sun; they found three (3) men already in the house armed with long boloes sandalan recognized two of them as teofilo gande and victoriano gande because they were abaca strippers in the plantation of sayawon; he did not know the third man teofilo gande requested that he and his two companions be allowed to pass the night in the house as it was already getting dark after witness teofilo sandalan had received his share of the cock he left and proceeded home when he was some 70 to 80 meters away by a brook where he had defecated he heard a womans shout for help he returned to sayawons house; he did not go up but went underneath the house and through the splitbamboo flooring and by the dim light of a ""gotapercha"" lamp (it was already twilight) he saw the accused teofilo gande cutting the neck of sayawon who lay upon a mortar witness sandalan did not tarry but rushed home and told his parents what he saw; they did not believe him as he had been wont to lie to them but when they went to sayawons house the following morning to verify what their son had related they found the four (4) occupants of the house dead sayawons body was on top of a mortar his head almost severed at the neck; dagaw hacked at the back of the neck lay on the floor near the stove; amping lay face downward where he used to sleep hacked at the nape and on the arm; and dana was sprawled flat on her stomach at the attic injured at the epigastric region (tsn 23 february 1967 pages 3242; 24 february 1967 pages 2 8 and 27; 13 june 1967 page 6) pc sgt cleofe jonco testified that he had teofilo gande investigated on 9 october 1965; that he propounded the questions and gande supplied the answers which were reduced to writing (tsn 23 february 1967 pages 23); that thereafter on 11 october 1965 sgt alberto orquillas brought teofilo gande to the municipal judge to swear to the truth of his statements but according to orquillas after talking to a certain person gande refused to sign the statement for no reason at all (tsn 23 february 1967 page 8) the unsigned statement exhibit ""a"" purported to confess teofilo gandes participation in a conspiracy to rob the household of sayawon; his presence there during the killing of the four victims not by him but by his brother victoriano and one malcolm; and his confessing to the philippine constabulary officers because he was not given a share of the booty that malcolm had taken from a jar in the attic on the side of the defense accusedappellant teofilo gande testifying in his behalf claimed that during the whole day of 25 september 1965 he together with eight (8) other persons including his brother victoriano worked ""bayanihan"" style in the farm of rosario limbaring in barrio lalud until sundown; when they stopped working they took their ""merienda"" and then teofilo gande went home (tsn 12 july 1967 pages 3034) this alibi deserves no credit for the supporting witnesses abdul and sofronio lumbay were vague and uncertain in their statements the only circumstance of which they were positive was of gandes presence at the ""songlo"" (cooperative work) on 25 june but could not supply details about the work on the other days of the week we conclude that no error was committed by the court in rejecting the alibi of appellant appellant testified that three (3) pc soldiers manhandled him one after the other to compel him to sign exhibit ""a""; that he was shown the said exhibit already prepared but did not see how it was prepared; that as a result of the maltreatment he suffered injuries which he had shown to the judge of tudela and to a friend abdul lumbay who visited him in jail; that he did not recognize his torturers because it was nighttime; and that he is illiterate and belongs to the subano tribe (tsn 12 july 1967 pages 24 10) the version of the appellant is supported by judge solidario agot of tudela who testified that exhibit ""a"" was presented to him but that the supposed affiant appellant teofilo gande ""disagreed on all the statement of that affidavit"" and ""refused to sign because it was not voluntarily made by him""; and that he saw a fresh contusion on the lower part of gandes right eye but the latter did not complain that he was maltreated by the pc (tsn 19 july 1967 pages 34 8) it is regrettable that the judge did not examine the rest of the body of appellant to ascertain whether he suffered other injuries however the circumstances sufficiently infirm the reliability of the purported confession particularly since there is no independent evidence of the alleged robbery; no proof exists on the record that the coins asserted by witness biato mapon to have been kept in two jars placed in the attic were still there when the crime was committed that the accused did not complain of torture to judge agot is not to be wondered at for being in the custody of his torturers he was reasonably apprehensive of further maltreatment if he complained in view of the circumstances of record the alleged statements of appellant are rejected as of no probative value with the alleged confession (exhibit ""a"") aside the evidence on the alleged conspiracy consists of the testimony of anselmo gumalay to the effect that he saw teofilo gande with two companions pass by the house of bastiana soling towards the house of sayawon lumigaw while said witness was grinding corn and the testimony of teofilo sandalan that he saw the gande brothers and a third man armed with long boloes when he and sayawon came from the ""parian"" and that he saw gande cutting the neck of sayawon sandalan had vacillated in his testimony or was unsure of what victorians gande and the third man did or were doing when gande was cutting sayawons neck and it was on account of this uncertainty that the lower court acquitted victoriano gande (the third man was not charged in the information) such action of the appellant and his brother and even of the nonaccused third man do not warrant a finding of the existence of a conspiracy just because they were seen together draws no inference of a common plan to commit a crime there is no convincing evidence that victorians and the third man committed any overt act or actively participated in concert with appellants act of killing sayawon or in connection with the death of the other victims as to deduce a unity of action and purpose among themselves (article 8 revised penal code; people vs asaad 55 phil 697; people vs wong l2213032 29 april 1968; people vs vicente l26241 21 may 1969) nor is there evidence that the money testified to by mapon as having been kept in the attic was still there or that it was taken away by the accused after the death of the four (4) victims none of the witnesses for the prosecution who went to the house after the commission of the crime testified as to the absence or loss of the money; not even sgt manuel mu?z who went there precisely to investigate and even drew a sketch of the house and the respective positions of the victims obviously the taking of the money cannot be presumed; it must be proved since the loss or disappearance of the money was not proved two essential elements of robbery are missing namely intent to gain (animus lucrandi) and unlawful taking or asportation (padilla criminal law vol ii page 635) in view thereof we can not declare that there was robbery "

incised forefinger left posterior (16) wound contused thigh right middle third anterior dr asanias established the approximate time of death as of the morning of june 28 1963 and the cause thereof as severe hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds acting upon information linking the appellants to the death of the decedent the two policemen went to arrest them that afternoon and brought them to the municipal building for investigation returning to barrio santor to look for the possible weapons used valdez got from hilarions mother his bloodstained bolo (exh b) and a bloodstained shirt (exh c) mangligot on the other hand obtained from the house of gregorio a bloodstained bolo (exh f)and a bloodstained calendar leaf (exh g) said appellants were pinpointed due to the presence of quirino callo and two young boys benjamin balicat age 12 and nonito salmazan age 13 who were all pasturing their carabaos in the fields near the scene of the killing the three gave sworn statements before the municipal mayor who conducted a preliminary examination on june 29 1963 in the absence of the municipal judge and on july 1 1963 they resubscribed their affidavits before the municipal judge balicat testified that in the early morning of june 28 1963 he saw the four appellants all armed with bolos following and then chasing the decedent towards the creek south of barrio santor shortly afterwards he again saw the four coming from the same direction and going homeward with hilarion fausto and gregorio holding blooddrenched bolos salmazan and callo declared that they saw the four appellants that morning coming from the same direction where on june 29 1963 the dead body of carlino perdido was found of the four only hilarion and fausto had their bolos unsheathed appellants impute to the trial court as first error its having relied upon the prosecution witnesses and in not upholding their allegedly credible defenses according to them what really happened was this fausto and his brother gregorio were in dugo cagayan from june 26 to june 28 1963 together with their father and brotherinlaw who brought sabas constantino to the camalaniugan emergency hospital for treatment marcelo was in his house in barrio santor the whole morning of june 28 1963 hilarion killed the decedent but only in selfdefense the defense of fausto gregorio and marcelo is therefore alibi but it is too well settled that alibi can not overcome the positive identification of the accused unless the prosecution witnesses are unreliable or unworthy of credence — which is primarily for the trial court to determine— and the accuseds presence in some other place is clearly and convincingly established here the lower court gave much credence to the prosecution witnesses especially to the youthful balicat and salmazan we see no cogent reason to reverse it these two immediately gave their sworn declarationsto the authorities upon the discovery of the crime on june 29 1963 it would have been quite hard for them to concoct a falsehood within so short a time the records disclose that on july 31 1963 both made written declarations exhs( 11 and 12) somewhat at variance with their previous affidavits however the lower court rejected these declarations on the finding that they were prepared under suspicious circumstances as evidenced by the fact that exh 11 bears thumbmark imprints whereas the affidavits found on pp 15 to 16 of the records bear the signature ""benjamin balicat"" (exh p)in addition we also note that exhs 11 and 12 were not sworn to and what is more although counsel for appellants had them all the while they were never presented to the two boys for explanation during the trialthe flaws and defects in the testimonies of the principal prosecution witnesses raised by appellants are too insubstantial to merit serious consideration the relationship of balicat callo and encarnacion perdido to the decedent does not necessarily vitiate their otherwise credible testimoniesbalicats presence near the scene of the crime on the morning of june 28 1963 is established not only by his testimony in court but also by his sworn affidavit and the statement (exh 11) taken by appellants counsel salmazans statement that balicat told him about the chasing of the decedent by the appellants is hearsay to prove the chasing but as balicat himself testified that he told the former about it that merely corroborates the fact that the two boys talked about the incidenthowever salmazan is himself an eyewitness to the fact that appellants came from the place where the dead body of the decedent was found appellants also cite a portion of the testimony of the decedents widow showing that it was stormy and rainy in the morning of june 28 1963 but they have conveniently omitted her succeeding statement denying that it was raining hard that morninglastly we can draw suspicious inference from the fact that quirino callo did not immediately denounce appellants before the authorities on june 28 1963 since he did not actually see them kill the victim but only saw them 300 meters away from the scene of the crime the alibi set up by appellants fausto and gregorio is not convincing although they claimed that in the reply morning of june 28 1963 they were still in dugo cagayan 70 kms away they have failed to prove that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crimeit was not impossible for them to have gone back to barrio santor on the evening of june 27 since they had nothing more to do in dugo assuming they really went there in fact two witnesses saw them in barrio santor that very evening — policeman mangligot while patrolling there and faustos own wife who said on direct examination that he slept at home on the night of june 27 1963 the only nonrelative who would corroborate the alibi of fausto and gregorio is francisco salvador who testified that in the morning of june 28 1963 he saw the two with their father ignacio in the motorboat while crossing the cagayan river this cannot overcome the positive identification made by the three prosecution witnesses who had no evil motive against the appellants salvadors testimony is comparatively weak since it does not appear that he conversed at all with fausto and gregorio moreover it is highly improbable that salvador could still remember ignacio constantino whom he met two years before while on a hectic campaign trail at night and for a very short time only marcelos uncorroborated alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the prosecution witnesses for stronger reasons since on the morning of june 28 he was at home in barrio santor not more than 2 kms away from the scene of the crime he was too near to altogether preclude his guilt hilarion admits having killed the decedent but insists that it was in selfdefense only according to him while attending a benefit dance in barrio santor sometime in june 1963 but the exact date of which he could not place he had an altercation with the decedent wherein he knocked down the latter the decedent then threatened to kill him and in the early morning of june 281963 while he was alone mending the gaps in their rice paddies the decedent came stabbed him suddenly hitting him below the right elbow and then chased him to the creek but there he was able to hold the decedents hand and then stabbed the latter successively on the left side this plea of selfdefense is belied and negatived however by a number of reasons first is the nature number and location of the decedents woundshilarions version cannot explain the three wounds at the back and the other wound in the neck — directed downwards — of the decedent the medico legal officer moreover stated that more than one weapon was used secondly the alleged bolo used by the decedent was not presented nor was its non presentation explained third hilarions silence and failure to immediately report to the authorities the alleged attack upon him by the decedent shows that he was not really innocent had he done so he could have easily shown to them the wound allegedly inflicted by the decedent which must still have been fresh by then he had ample opportunity to do so in the investigation conducted on june 30 1963 lastly the decedent had no motive to assault him for contrary to hilarions claim no benefit dance was held in barrio santor in the month of june 1963 as established by police chief damaso dumlao who keeps a record of all the permits therefor and barrio lieutenant de la cruz the supposed altercation between hilarion and the decedent thus appears to be a mere fabrication appellants next assail the imposition by the lower court of a uniform penalty for all of them in the absence of direct proof of conspiracy there were however sufficient facts and circumstances which impliedly showed conspiracy in this connection we deem it sufficient to quote from the decision of the trial judge as a whole the circumstances that the accused with bolos chased carlino perdido that afterwards they returned walking with hilarion constantino and fausto constantino holding their bolos with bloodstains while marcelo and gregorio constantino had their bolos tucked at their waists; that the body of carlino perdido was found later on in the place where these accused came from; that the bolos exhibits b and f with bloodstains were found in the homes of hilarion and gregorio constantino respectively; that marcelo constantino made the threats on the night of june 27 1963 to carlino perdido and that the calendar sheet exhibit g with bloodstains was found in the house of gregorio constantino all these point conclusively to the participation of the accused in the death of carlino perdido and show their guilt beyond reasonable doubt the motive on the part of the accused to kill carlino perdido is because they wanted to avenge on carlino perdido the death of their kin sabas constantino who was allegedly killed by inocencio romaguera a brotherinlaw of carlino perdido they suspected that the disappearance of inocencio romaguera was made so by carlino perdido thus marcelo constantino threatened carlino perdido to produce the body of inocencio romaguera otherwise he would be liquidated the last error alleged is the failure of the lower court to appreciate certain mitigating circumstances in favor of appellants again we see no error incomplete selfdefense and unlawful provocation by the decedent can not be considered in hilarions favor since his version of the decedents aggression is pure fabrication there is neither passion and obfuscation nor proximate vindication of a grave offense since the killing of the decedent was four days after the stabbing of appellants kin moreover it is doubtful if vengeance can be considered as a lawful sentiment "

G.R. No. L-27791,Parricide,0,"the lower court in the appealed judgment relied principally on the testimony of an eyewitness dionisia malasarteshe declared on the witness stand that on september 1 1960 at about 400 oclock in the afternoon the deceased ricardo manos left a bolo and two bamboo tubes in her sarisari store located in alegria lopez jaena misamis occidental at about 600 that evening of the same day he returned to the store this time accompanied by appellant he informed the witness then upstairs that he came back to get the things he left with her she went down so that she could give them back to him it was then that she heard him tell the appellant that it was time to go home as it was already night and his grandson a child of the appellant would be looking for him apparently appellant misconstrued the remark and asked his father whether he resented the fact that he was taking care of such child ricardo manos took care to explain that such was not the case for otherwise the child might not have lived till then appellant implied that the father was in a bad mood precisely because of the trouble occasioned by the rearing of the grandson at this juncture he pushed aside his father who fell down face upward it was then that appellant dealt the blows with his bolo that proved fatal the victim was hit first in the stomach and then in the breast dionisia malasarte rushed to appellant held him by the waist and pulled him away reproving him for his act he was told to stop but the advice came too late as the victim was already dead she then shouted for help a man came on the scene but the deed as above noted had been consummated she then sent for the authorities the chief of police coming that evening the following morning the judge of that municipality a doctor and a sanitary inspector came it was an entirely different story testified to by the accused santiago manos who pleaded selfdefense he would ascribe the antecedents of the tragic incident to his leaving a brotherhood association in which and his deceased father were members evidently such an act displeased the latter he was berated for his resignation which in the view of the father according to the appellant was a foolish thing to do sensing that he was under the influence of alcohol and was thus in an ugly mood appellant tried to pacify the deceased but his efforts were unsuccessful then so he would impress on the court his father rushed at him he tried to pacify the latter by saying that he was not going to fight in view of their relationship his father according to him was not appeased feeling that he was about to be killed and that he had to defend himself his father having unsheathed his own bolo he was fortunate enough to be able to pin both of his fathers hands against his stomachthen he proceeded ""he struggled and he was able to free himself he blocked me again and pinned me holding in that position i still asked him and told him i do not want to fight him because he is my father after telling me i have no son santiago he again attempted to unsheath his bolo and fortunately i was able to pin his both hands on his belly but he was able to extricate himself and then he held my hand and attempted to draw out his bolo and still i was able to pin his hand and continued pleading that i do not like to fight him inasmuch as i am the son and he is my father at this moment he insisted on the fight and inasmuch as he was able to move and was able to unsheath his bolo i parried it and pinned both of his hands i drew my bolo and placed it in front of me just with the intention to avoid his onrushing actions to kill me""he continued his efforts to pacify his father and according to him it was then that the deceased ""rushed at me which made the bolo to penetrate to his stomach""as to how the other wound was inflicted this was his version ""i did not make any attempt to lunge at him it was my fathers unexpected onrushing towards me that made the bolo penetrate his breast""from the above testimony it becomes easy to understand why the lower court failed to believe appellants story it does tax ones credulity an impartial party even if sympathetic to the plight in which appellant found himself would find it difficult to give a nod of approval to such a narration it might be said of course that the act imputed to the appellant that of killing his own father is one that is so shocking that there must have been an impelling motive from the testimony of appellant himself as well as that of his mother it turned out that the deceased was not a model family man he was drunk very often and on such occasions his wife the mother of the appellant was maltreated at such times he did not limit himself to using his fists but would even employ his bolo thus causing wounds to be inflicted on his wife the bitterness arising from such display of cruelty must have built up through the years in appellants heart as from his testimony he did hold his mother in the highest affection that incident that afternoon when he felt that he was being berated by his father must have brought to the surface the seething and smoldering feeling of resentment deep within him "

G.R. Nos. 122510-11,Murder,2,"the witnesses presented by the prosecution were emma bangot ramon de asis jeremias baguhin rolando latayada rodel calo dr jose g ladrido jr concepcion porras virginia ocleda dulcesima duay and atty ridgeway tanjili emma bangot a waitress of kasiyahan pub house located along cm recto st davao city testified that at about 900 pm of 12 january 1990 she had a conversation with duay and gabuyan she knew them to be agents of the metrodiscom antinarcotics unit (manu) since they would usually post themselves along the area to observe persons buying prohibited drugs at the 5m drug store located across the pub house a while later emma saw gabuyan collared by pat romarate who was with heracleo and gregorio duay approached romarate identifying himself as a manu agent romarate ignored him and handcuffed both duay and gabuyan the two were then dragged into the groups vehicle emma immediately reported what she saw to the office of the manu several days later at the anticrime unit office she positively identified romarate heracleo and gregorio from pictures provided by the investigator as the persons who seized duay and gabuyan ramon de asis was watching television at home on the night of 12 january 1990 when he saw four persons in the vicinity of his house one of them already dead he did not see the face of the dead person which was ""lying face down"" but he recognized heracleo and gregorio who were his neighbors romarate told ramon that ""we killed him nong because he is a sparrow"" ramon ordered the three to remove the dead body then went inside the house jeremias baguhin a member of the philippine national police declared that at around 900 am of 17 february 1990 while he and police officers floribel and paguidaton were patrolling the bankerohan area of davao city he learned that the perpetrators in the killing of duay and gabuyan wanted to surrender jeremias and his companions immediately went to ""matadahan"" where they found heracleo and gregorio waiting for them the two told him that they had knowledge of the death of duay and gabuyan in the hands of romarate and that they wanted to surrender because their conscience was bothering them jeremias brought them to the anticrime office for investigation in the afternoon of the same day romarate was apprehended but he denied having killed duay and gabuyan during confrontation heracleo and gregorio pointed to romarate as the alleged mastermind rolando latayada a manu agent who acted as a lookout of duay and gabuyan corroborated the testimony of emma on the latters apprehension by romarate heracleo and gregorio rodel calo a member of the anticrime task force of the philippine national police davao city said that on 17 february 1990 heracleo and gregorio were referred to him for investigation regarding the death of duay and gabuyan after they were apprised of their constitutional rights heracleo and gregorio told him they did not need the assistance of a lawyer and they were willing to give a statement nevertheless rodel called atty rideway tanjili assistant regional attorney of the public assistance office (pao) to assist them in signing a sworn statement waiving their rights to counsel and to remain silent atty tanjili substantially corroborated this point on 19 february 1990 heracleo and gregorio executed an extrajudicial confession in the presence of fiscal garcia wherein they narrated their participation in the commission of the crime dr jose ladrido jr a medicolegal officer testified that he conducted an autopsy on the cadavers of duay and gabuyan on 15 january 1990 he found rope marks on duays wrists and the wrists of gabuyan were tied with a ""tire wire"" both sustained multiple stab wounds dr ladrido then prepared a necropsy report duays wife dulcesima testified that she cried and collapsed upon learning of the death of her husband and that she spent p25000 more or less during the wake prior to his death duay had been working as a security guard and as an agent of the manu on the other hand the witnesses for the defense were gregorio heracleo pedrita manriquez and police officer teodoro paguiducon a member of the anticrime unit gregorio neighbor of both heracleo and romarate at bankerohan davao city testified that on 12 january 1990 hermina herrera told him to see her commonlaw husband romarate later gregorio and heracleo met romarate who was having a drinking session with butong and dida dae rolando corsolado and herrera at about 700 pm romarate and his group stopped drinking he asked gregorio to accompany him in a buybust operation to be conducted at 5m drug store gregorio and heracleo went with romarate corsonado butong dae and herrera romarate tried to buy at the rose pharmacy a drug know as ""pidol"" which he described as an appetizer but failed so he proceeded to the 5m drug store again romarate was not given the drug heracleo offered to buy the drug after being assured by romarate that there was nothing to worry about having bought the drug heracleo crossed the street toward his companions but was arrested by gabuyan upon seeing the incident romarate with a drawn gun approached gabuyan and ordered the latter to release heracleo gabuyan was handcuffed and brought near a theater thereafter romarate went toward duay poked a gun at him and frisked him for weapons a gun tucked in duays waist was confiscated by romarate duay and gabuyan were brought to the residence of heracleo where gregorio watched romarate corsonado and butong dae tie the hands of duay and gabuyan with wires and gag their mouths with handkerchiefs to prevent them from shouting meanwhile heracleo left to play basketball gregorio further testified that at about 1000 pm gabuyan and duay were brought near the river situated 15 meters from heracleos house he saw romarate corsonado and butong dae take turns in repeatedly stabbing the two he could not run away because romarates gun was pointed at him romarate even ordered heracleo to shoot duay whose body was thrown into the river heracleo only fired a shot into the air a while later ramon de asis arrived and was told by romarate that the victims were killed because they were members of the npa after the incident gregorio and heracleo still saw each other while romarate corsonado and butong dae avoided them at one time they decided to seek the aid of heracleos mother pedrita manriquez so that they could surrender to the proper authorities and ""to know who is at fault"" on 17 february 1990 gregorio and heracleo surrendered to police officer teodoro paguiducon gregorio alleged that during investigation he was not informed of his rights to counsel and to remain silent he denied having admitted before the national police commission that he had any participation in the killing of the victims for his part heracleo asserted that he had no participation in the killing of gabuyan and duay his testimony mostly corroborated that of gregorio concerning the incident of 12 january 1990 he confirmed that he and gregorio voluntarily surrendered to the police on 17 february 1990 and that they executed a sworn statement at the residence of atty tanjili on the latters promise that they would not be implicated in the crime but instead be utilized as state witnesses their story was corroborated by pedrita manriquez and officer teodoro paguiducon gregorio maintains that the oral admission and extrajudicial confession he gave before the police authorities cannot be used as evidence against him because his waiver of his rights to remain silent and to counsel during custodial interrogation cannot be characterized as one made knowingly voluntarily and intelligently since (1) the sworn statement was written in english and there was no proof that the preliminary questions and answers therein were translated much less a translation after every question and answer in his alleged waiver into the visayancebuano dialect a language spoken and understood by him; (2) there was no proof that he then only 18 years old and a 4th grader clearly understood the import and consequences of the waiver which was ""couched in broad and general terms""; (3) the sworn statement related only to his alleged disinterest to be represented by a counsel but it did not signify an agreement to make a confession of the crime with which he was charged; (4) he executed the sworn statement not knowing that an extrajudicial confession was attached thereto and; (5) the presence of his mother during the signing of the waiver did not guarantee that the same was done voluntarily and intelligently likewise gregorio vehemently denies the existence of a conspiracy in the commission of the felony he argues that conceding that he dutifully followed the orders of romarate it was only because the latter was a police officer and armed while he was not a minor and in no position to dispute or oppose the orders of romarate apart from his extrajudicial confession which became the sole basis for the trial courts judgment of conviction there was no proof that a conspiracy existed in blatant disregard of the rule that independent evidence and proof beyond reasonable doubt are required in order to establish a conspiracy the records show that the document of waiver (exh f"") signed by gregorio was prepared on 7 february 1990 but was subscribed and sworn to on 19 february 1990 before asst city prosecutor jose garcia "
G.R. No. 138402,Homicide,1,"the facts on august 17 1996 there was a benefit dance held at the barangay hall of meohao kidapawan cotabato the dance ended at 1230 am the following day leolito attended the dance on august 18 1996 at around 100 am leolito who just came from the dance was seen by prosecution witness remegia obenza (hereinafter referred to as ""remegia"") with accusedappellant arnold gonzales on a bench outside her storeleolito was asleep on the bench presumably it was while he was sleeping that someone with a dagger snuffed out his life there were no eyewitnesses to the actual stabbing the prosecution thus had the task of knitting the pieces of evidence together into a thriving whole an accusing finger was pointed at gonzales as he was the last person seen with leolito before he was stabbed dead on august 18 1996 a postmortem examination was conducted on leolitos body we quote the relevant parts of the report""pertinent findings ""chest and back multiple stab wounds on the right anterior chest on the level of 2nd intercostal space midclavicular line measuring 4 cms in lenght (sic) and 4 ins in depth; 3rd ics mcl measuring 3 cms in lenght (sic) and 4 ins in depth; on the left anterior chest on the level of the 2nd and 3rd ics parasternal area measuring 5 cms in lenght (sic) and 4 ins in depth; and on the sternal area lower 3rd measuring 2 cms in lenght (sic) stab wound on the thoracolumbar area measuring 2 cms in lenght (sic) and 2 ins in depth ""cause of death acute blood loss secondary to multiple stab wounds"" (1) shortly after the crime was committed gonzales admitted to a certain juny habla that he stabbed the victim prosecution witness juny habla testified that on august 18 1996 at around 200 am gonzales came to his house at palusok muaan kidapawan city he was wearing a bloodied shirt in the presence of junys brother and sister gonzales admitted that he stabbed leolito gonzales requested juny to accompany him to the house of a certain egoy cornejo to surrenderjunys testimony should not be disregarded true the records do not show whether juny was a confidant or close friend of gonzales however we note that admissions as evidenceneed not be made only to close friends the utterance could have very well been a part of the res gestaeit is not uncommon for one who is confronted with a startling occurrence to panic and seek the help of an acquaintance or even a stranger while it is a wonder why one would make such an incriminating confession to a stranger it is more incredible for one with no motive or feelings of illwill to testify falsely against another incriminating him in a grievous crimewhen there is no showing that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by an improper motive the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is thus entitled to full faith and creditit is equally important to note that junys testimony was unrebutted and that cross examination was waived by the defensethe defense could have questioned the veracity of the testimony having failed to do so junys testimony which the trial court correctly considered as credible stands unscathed(2) gonzales was the last person to be seen with the victim before he died remegia categorically stated that shortly before the victim was stabbed she saw gonzales with leolito on a bench outside her store true mere presence at the scene of the crime is not tantamount to guilthowever this is not the only circumstance availing here we recall the case of people v santosthere we affirmed the conviction of the accused on the basis of circumstantial evidence there two of the four compelling linkswere that (1) the accused were the last persons seen with the victim as it is so in the case at bar and (2) there were police officers who testified on the conditions of the accused at the time of arrest conditions which indicated their guilt again a circumstance present in this case (3) upon discovering that the victim had died (from the stab wounds) gonzales uttered a statement displaying apathy inconsistent with innocence remegia also testified that she heard gonzales trying to wake the victim she heard gonzales say to another ""patay na na patay na na mo report lang ko ugma"" (he is already dead i will just report it tomorrow)the indifferent and unperturbed tenor of the statement is significant it is not normal for one who innocently chances upon a dead man lying in his own pool of blood to nonchalantly shrug it off and announce that he ""will just report (it) tomorrow"" such apathy is inconsistent with innocence facts or circumstances that are consistent with guilt and are inconsistent with innocence constitute evidence with weight and probative forceremegia heard gonzales speak she knew gonzales since he was a boy she was familiar with him and could identify him by the mere sound of his voice expertise in voice identification is not necessary reliance on ones sense of hearing and recollection suffices(4) police officers spo1 espadera and spo3 salmorin testified that when they arrested gonzales he was wearing a bloodstained shirtneither may the testimonies of spo1 espadera and spo3 salmorin be ignored no proof of bias or ill motive to falsely implicate gonzales was shown furthermore credence should be accorded to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who are law enforcersthe well entrenched rule is that assessment of the credibility of witnesses is within the province of the trial court it is the trial court and not this court that had the opportunity to observe the witnesses manner of testifying their furtive glances calmness sighs or their scant or full realization of their oathsspo3 salmorin was not crossexamined by the defenseand the statements he thus uttered were not rebutted a persons silence particularly when it is persistent may justify an inference that he is not innocentthe trial court was more inclined to believe the prosecution absent any arbitrariness or gross mistake so should we the nonpresentation of the bloodstained shirt in evidence being merely corroborative of other evidence on record is not fatal to the prosecutions case sec 4 rule 133 of the revised rules of court provides""sec 4 circumstantial evidence when sufficient circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if ""(a) there is more than one circumstance; ""(b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven and ""(c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt"" in our mind the four aforementioned circumstances form an unbroken chain of events leading to one fair conclusionthat gonzales perpetrated the crime a degree of proof excluding all possibility of error is not required to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt absolute certainty is not required only moral certainty is in this case the evidence meets a degree of proof sufficient to produce conviction in an unprejudiced mindaccuseds defense is alibi and denial gonzales defense is alibi and denial the weakest of all defensesgiven the straightforward candid and positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the negative testimony of gonzales the positive testimonies must prevail"
G.R. No. 133918,Homicide,1,"the records show that on december 31 1993 at about 900 pm teresita navarro together with her husband florencio navarro and their two daughters were on their way to church to

reached up to the shoulders of a grown manflorencio walked about twenty meters behind his daughters while teresita was about four meters behind him although it was a moonlit night teresita held a torch to light her way all of a sudden florencio heard a gunshot from behind he immediately looked back and saw his wife lying on the ground the torch she was holding fell but continued to burn with the light coming from the moon and the torch florencio saw the accused albacin approaching him coming from where his wife was he recognized albacin because he personally knew him as his neighbor for more than twenty yearsthen another man wearing a big hat emerged from the ramie plants and approached florencio on his right side at a distance of about half a meter at the right front side of florencio albacin pointed a gun at florencios forehead albacin then fired his gun twice the first shot hitting florencio on his right back hand and the second shot grazing the middle portion of his

""lapad"" until 200 am of january 1 1994 tongson went to bed at 200 am that morning he saw the accused cooking at 700 amon rebuttal gilbert navarro barangay captain of lasang took the witness stand he testified that lasang is the last barangay of davao city its boundary is panabo between lasang and cacao a barangay in panabo there are two barangays from lasang cacao can be reached via the national highway alternatively a barangay road where jeeps trucks and motorcycles pass may be taken the distance between these two barangays via the barangay road is about eight kilometersflorencio navarro was recalled on rebuttal he testified that when he would buy pigs he would always traverse by foot the distance between lasang poblacion to the 75th infantry batallion camp in cacao walking at a slow pace it would take him one hour to cover the distance of only six kilometers because the camp is at the edge of barangay katipunan which is only five kilometers away from lasang barangay katipunan is adjacent to barangay cacao the distance of eight kilometers from lasang to cacao on the other hand refers to the center of cacao he reiterated that the accused albacin shot both his wife and himself (florencio)the accused was the only person florencio saw with his fallen wife immediately after he heard a gunshot from where his wife was with the light coming from the moon and teresitas torch florencio was able to recognize the accused albacin who has been his neighbor for more than twenty years he testified as follows ""q while walking in that position your daughter ahead of you 20 meters and your wife 4 meters (sic) you said you heard a gunshot a yes sir i heard a gunshot q what was your reaction when you heard that gunshot a i looked at my (sic) back and saw my wife already fell down q what else did you see aside from see (sic) your wife already fell down a what i saw was the same person (sic) and he approached me q how many persons did you see aside from your wife a only one later on there was another one who approached me q you said a person when you turned your back and saw your wife fell down you saw a person was approaching you who is that person who approached you a i do not know sir he was wearing a hat q earlier you pointed to the accused what did the accused do after your wife fell a that is why after that he approached me and pointed a gun at me court q when you saw the accused you saw the accused approaching you where did he come from a from the place where my wife fell down""(emphasis supplied) dr ledesma the medicolegal expert who examined teresitas body testified that teresita probably died of the gunshot wound she sustained on her head he also concluded that she was shot from within two feet albacin carried a gun with which he shot florencio these circumstances lead us to no other conclusion than that the accused albacin fatally shot teresita direct evidence ie an eyewitness account of the commission of the crime is not always necessary to identify the accused as the perpetrator of the crime a witness may not have actually seen the very act of commission of a crime but he may nevertheless identify the accused as the assailant as when the latter is the person or one of the persons last seen with the victim immediately before and right after the commission of the crimesustain the conviction of an accused through circumstantial evidence the rules on evidence and jurisprudence require that (1) there must be more than one circumstance; (2) the inference must be based on proven facts; and (3) the combination of all circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accusedcontrary to accused albacins allegation the threeday delay in florencios identification of the accused albacin as the assailant does not erode his credibility we have previously ruled that delay in revealing the author of the crime does not impair the credibility of witnesses more so if such delay is satisfactorily explainedflorencio admitted that initially he was not able to reveal the identity of the assailant because he was not in his right mind immediately after the shooting incident a few days after the dastardly act was committed he refused to reveal the identity of the perpetrator of the crimes because he wanted to take revenge against the accused albacin it was only upon insistence of his daughter teresa that he was prevailed upon to report to the authorities the identity of the assailant and accordingly file a case against him "
G.R. Nos. 106345-46,Murder,2,"the tusons and the villarins are more than mere neighbors in the semipermanent structures they call home in project 6 quezon city; they are also cousins this dual relationship should have fostered harmonious coexistence among them but such was not the case sometime in october 1990 accusedappellant romeo tuson and his first cousin loreto villarin were engaged in a fight over gambling matters bolo marks on the door of tusons shanty attest to the violence that attended their quarrel three days later on october 11 their differences were finally settled the brothers loreto and ceferino villarin were drunk and tipsy that night after celebrating another brothers birthday at forest hills at around 1045 pm ceferino who was seated beside the wooden window of their singlestorey house saw loreto who was clad only in his underwear make his way to the common lavatory loreto never reached his destination for he was suddenly shot in the neck by tuson who was standing by the door of his own slightlyelevated shack which was adjacent to the toilet ceferino rushed to rescue his brother but was likewise shot by tuson in the face three other prosecution witnesses heard the twin shots; two of them actually saw the shooting of ceferino by tuson ceferinos wife evelyn and nephew hernani villeta who was living with them immediately rushed to the door of their house after hearing the gunshot and saw tuson shoot ceferino in the face as the latter tried to help his brother loretos wife rosalinda heard everything but did not have the heart to look out all three testified that tuson shouted ""ikaw pa!"" prior to the second shot when ceferino was already down he was threatened by tuson not to rise lest he be shot a second time hernani shouted and succeeded in pleading with his uncle romeo to stop forthwith tuson fled with timely medical attention by dr marida arend arugay of the east avenue medical center ceferinos life was saved the downward trajectory of the bullet extracted from his neck indicated that the assailant fired the gun from a higher elevation the same was true with the bullet that killed loreto as it entered the right side of the neck and exited between the two shoulder blades tuson claims he shot the brothers in selfdefense his story was that he was sleeping with his wife teresita and their two children on that fateful night when loreto barged into their oneroom house shouting ""tayo! putangina mo!"" although it is not clear if it was loreto who was armed — tuson himself testified that he heard ceferino from outside the door shouting that ""he has a gun"" — tuson asserted that he tried to wrest a gun away from loreto while grappling for possession of the gun they both fell near the threestep stairway and with loreto on top of him the went off somehow the blast sent loreto flipping over the twofoot rail guard barring the door down the three steps finally resting on the ground outside seeing that ceferino who was allegedly armed with a bladed weapon was rising he also shot him he immediately fled threw away the gun and went into hiding for nine days before surrendering to the police on october 20 1990 his story was corroborated by his wife and older sister nieves sotto no bladed weapon was recovered from the crime scene sotto testified that prior to the shooting the brothers villarin were challenging her youngest brother romeo loreto was on the stairs of romeos house telling the latter to go out because his coffin was ready all the while banging the door yet on crossexamination she admitted that she did not notice who opened the door of romeos house because she was then embracing her husband who was sleeping on the floor of their own house in the course of the trial the court below found out that not only was the evidence of the defense weak but that the prosecutions was sufficient to support the charges against the accused tuson admitted having shot the brothers villarin albeit in selfdefense for such a defense to be appreciated in favor of the accused the trial court must be satisfied that the three elements necessary to justify the acts complained of attended their commission first there must be unlawful aggression on the part of the victim second the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression must be reasonably necessary finally the person defending himself must not have provoked the victim into committing the act of aggression as correctly found by the trial court there was no unlawful aggression in this case the victims allegedly shouted threats and banged on the door of tuson but these acts hardly constitute unlawful aggression considering that the latter was within the security of his home which was surrounded by neighbors who also happened to be close relatives by tusons own account loreto barged into their house and commanded him to stand up which is far from threatening the peril feared could have emanated only from the firearm which loreto allegedly carried at the time and yet this too was vague even on the basis of tusons testimony he said that when he approached loreto ceferino who was outside shouted ""he has a gun"" it does not make sense for ceferino to announce to their intended victim that they had a gun it would seem more plausible that ceferino uttered the statement as a warning to his brother with the finding of absence of unlawful aggression the crimes charged can never be justified for there is nothing to prevent or repel even if there is lack of sufficient provocation on the part of tuson to make matters worse he fled immediately after the incident and went into hiding for more than a week these could not possibly be the actuations of a man claiming to be innocent of any wrongdoing to do so under the pretext of fear of retribution from other members of the victims family would not only be craven but also irrational considering that his wife and two children were left behind the evidence for the prosecution on the other hand is solid and convincing ceferino was not only an eyewitness to the slaying of his brother loreto but was himself a victim his narration of the circumstances surrounding the shooting is supported by the separate testimonies of their wives and nephew while it is true that they were tipsy on the night in question he denied that they went to tusons house and shouted there in fact loreto was simply in his underwear ready to sleep when nature called the ushaped construction of their socalled ""compound"" with the common toilet adjacent to romeos house directly opposite loretos required anyone wanting to use the lavatory to pass tusons house when loreto thus passed his cousins shanty which was elevated like the rest tuson who was standing by the door suddenly and without provocation shot him at nearpointblank range hernani villeta evelyn villarin and rosalinda villarin heard this first shot hernani and evelyn immediately rushed out to investigate the matter just in time to see tuson shooting ceferino as loreto lay sprawled on the ground the bullets which were fired at loreto and ceferino had downward trajectories which conformed with the relative positions of the assailant and his targets at the time of shooting the congruence between the testimonial and the physical evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that the witnesses for the prosecution were the ones telling the truth "

G.R. Nos. L-20555 and L-21449,Murder,2,"said cases arose from an incident which took place on november 29 1952 in front of the house of the deceased moises gomez a barrio lieutenant by a small street in barrio sto ni? san fernando pampanga at around four to four thirty in the afternoon it started with an altercation between donaciano vitug and alfredo briones and ended with zoilo castro briones companion shooting two persons who later got involved moises gomez who was killed and candido vitug who was wounded but did not die it is not disputed that at the time of the incident there were a number of persons inside the house of the deceased moises gomez where a game of monte was in progress the prosecution tried to establish through the testimony of donaciano vitug that he and his brother candido went to the house to look for some companions who were gambling there after staying for about twenty minutes he went out and met alfredo briones a policeman then in plain clothes and off duty who commented that it would be proper to put a hand grenade into the car owned by donaciano (tsn of feb 24 1955 vergara p 3) said car was then parked in the street in front of the deceaseds house they had exchanged words when zoilo castro briones companion also a policeman then off duty and in plainclothes came out of the house and asked briones if donaciano was tough as briones did not answer castro challenged donaciano to fight but the latter refused moises gomez arrived and tried to pacify castro explaining that donaciano will not fight as castro refused to listen gomez warned that ""before you harm him you better harm me first"" at this castro brushed gomez aside saying ""you are another"" gomez then raised his hands and said ""we will not fight you"" however castro stepped back and calling him ""son of a harlot"" pulled out his gun and fired at gomez who was hit in the head and fell (tsn of dec 23 1955 maglalang pp 26) as gomez was shot candido vitug came out of the house castro also shot him hit by the first shot he fell to the ground and tried to protect himself by kicking castro as the latter continued to shoot at this instance donaciano got a piece of stone and hit castro on the head castro then faced donaciano and tried to shoot him but he grabbed castros arm they both fell on the ground as they grappled for the gun somehow castro was able to stand up but before he could shoot donaciano threw the stone at him castro ran with donaciano chasing him however donaciano was not able to catch him because he was able to board a jeepney (tsn ibid pp 67) donaciano then brought his brother to the hospital candido vitug testified that having been told that his brother was arguing with somebody he went out of the house to find out what was going on it was then that he was shot fallen to the ground he kicked castro every time the latter fired at him castro suddenly stopped firing at him and he saw donaciano grapple with castro after which castro was able to run away (tsn of march 16 1956 maglalang pp 2427 32)1?ph???t the vitugs foregoing testimony was corroborated by menen gomez who stated that he saw the incident happen as he was seated on one of the two jeeps parked in front of the house of the deceased conrada piligomez the deceaseds wife did not see the deceased being shot (tsn ibid p 37) but she testified to castros occasional presence in their house where her husband maintained a gambling den on that afternoon she testified to having seen menen gomez sitting with her son in the jeep (tsn ibid p 51) setting forth the theory of selfdefense zoilo castro and alfredo briones stated that they went to the house of the deceased merely to check a report that said deceased was again maintaining a gambling den during the exchange of words between them the deceased gomez pushed castro after which he felt himself hit on the head as castro fell on his knees dizzy he pulled out his gun and noticing that two men were coming at him shot them in the belief that he was about to be killed (tsn of may 6 1958 pp 7281; tsn of may 14 1957 maglalang pp 6465) jorge sangalang a puto vendor claimed that he saw a man hit castro with a big stone while the latter was talking to the deceased gomez (tsn of july 28 1958 maglalang pp 8890) there is no question that moises gomez and candido vitug were shot by zoilo castro precisely how this happened depends upon which of the conflicting testimonies of the parties are credible the court a quo gave credence to the testimony of the witnesses of the prosecution the rule adhered to by us in such cases is that ""as far as credibility and veracity of witnesses are concerned the conclusions of the lower court command great weight and respect on the ground that the trustworthiness of witnesses and the merit of the defenses by the accused are in the peculiar domain of the trial court""in this case we see no reason for departing from the same rule there being no showing that some fact or circumstance of great importance to the case has been overlooked in the records or misapplied or its significance misunderstood by the lower courtappellant for instance objects to the lower courts finding that he and briones proceeded to the deceaseds house with ""noise and fanfare"" on the ground that this is not found in the records the point however is that this circumstance is of no moment as far as the finding of guilt is concerned the records on the other hand show that even a defense witness ireneo talao testified that he saw castro shoot gomez as the latter was trying to pacify the former (tsn of april 6 1957 p 55) affidavits were presented in the attempt to dismiss the case that of conrada piligomez wherein she stated that she was no longer interested in the criminal action because she was convinced that gomezs death was accidental or unavoidable; those of menen gomez and of ireneo talao wherein both stated that they now realize that having been hit first castro merely shot in selfdefense it is our opinion that the lower court rightly disregarded these affidavits while conrada piligomez confirmed her affidavit under oath she admitted having agreed to castros proposal of settlement in consideration of p50000 (tsn of nov 11 1958 vergara pp 5758) and menen gomez and ireneo talao admitted in open court that they signed the affidavits upon the request of conrada piligomez who explained that the case was being amicably settled (tsn of nov 11 1958 vergara pp 5161) needless to stress the present criminal cases are not subject to compromise and the opinion of conrada piligomez as to the guilt of the accused is not controlling since she was not a witness to the incident in question "

G.R. No. 139822,Homicide,1,"that on or about the 12th day of december 1989 in the municipality of cabatuan province of iloilo philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court with deliberate intent and decided purpose to kill with treachery and evident premeditation armed with a 12 gauge homemade shotgun commonly known as ""pugakhang"" and without any justifiable cause or motive did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously assault attack and shoot one allan dominguez with the firearm accused was then provided inflicting upon said victim fatal gunshot wound on the head which caused the immediate death of said allan dominguez contrary to law (p 8 rollo) the prosecutions version of the generative facts as gathered from the testimony of its witnesses – guillermo dominguez father of the victim and annalyn dominguez sister of the victim – is abstracted in the appellees brief as follows at around 900 oclock in the evening of december 12 1989 prosecution witnesses guillermo dominguez and his daughter annalyn dominguez together with his son allan dominguez were in the house of the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita situated at janipaan central cabatuan iloilo appellant salvador caguing and his companion bebot malcaredo were also inside said house appellant was engaged in conversation with the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita in the course thereof appellant asked for the identity of allan dominguez after finding out the identity of allan appellant suddenly shot the former on the head with a shotgun resulting in his instantaneous death allan was seated on a chair beside a table while appellant was standing when the former was fatally shot afterwards appellant reloaded his shotgun and warned the people inside the house not to move thereafter appellant and his companion bebot malcaredo fled (pp 8485 rollo) dr mae albacite the rural health physician who conducted the autopsy on the victims body testified that the cause of death of the victim was severe hemorrhage from a skull fracture due to a gunshot wound in the head; that the wound was located at the forehead front with frontal and parietal bones missing which are parts of the skull; that the frontal lobe of the brain was already scattered on the face and skull of the victim; that there was the presence of an incised and gaping wound two inches by five inches located above the right ear up to the backbone located at the right side of the back; that the wound located at the frontal area with missing frontal and parietal bones was caused by a gunshot; that with regard to the incised wound it had rugged edges which could have been caused by a blunt object and there was the probability that it was caused by forcible tearing of the tissue due to impact of the gunshot; that even with adequate medical attention the probability of the victim living was nil because a vital organ was involved; and that there is a probability that the assailant was in front of the victim the version of the defense is based on the testimony of noe malcaredo y bebot friend of accusedappellant and accusedappellant himself accusedappellant denied the charge the defense that accusedappellant and the victim had an altercation and that he shot the victim in selfdefense was also advanced he particularly argues that treachery is negated by the fact that if accusedappellant were indeed armed when he arrived at 8 oclock in the evening an hour prior to the shooting incident that would have already put the victim on guard; that both prosecution witnesses never testified that accusedappellant was armed when he entered the place of the incident and their testimony are full of inconsistencies; that it was the victims persistence in attacking accusedappellant with a knife which led accusedappellant to shoot the victim in selfdefense; and lastly the declarations of the prosecution witnesses do not indicate any possible motive for accusedappellant to shoot the victim undisputed is the fact that accusedappellant shot one allan dominguez categorically he admitted that he shot the victim once in the forehead but asserts that he did so in selfdefense in selfdefense the burden of proof rests upon the accused (people vs timblor 385 scra 64 )it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself otherwise conviction would follow from his admission that he killed the victim (people vs cario 288 scra 404 )there are three requisites to prove the claim of selfdefense (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself unlawful aggression presupposes an actual sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof (people vs aguilar 292 scra 349 )the person defending himself must have been attacked with actual physical force or with actual use of weapon unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non for the justifying circumstance of selfdefense there can be no selfdefense complete or incomplete unless the victim has committed unlawful aggression against the person defending himself (people vs cario supra )in this case the testimony of accusedappellant himself belies the claim that he merely acted to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression allegedly coming from the victim accusedappellants unequivocal statements in open court lead to the conclusion that assuming arguendo that the victim indeed attempted to shoot accusedappellant with a handgun this aggression had ceased by the time accusedappellant was able to take possession of the gun in other words when accusedappellant successfully grabbed the gun from the victim there was no longer any unlawful aggression to prevent or repel and this court has consistently held that when the unlawful aggression which has begun no longer exists the one making the defense has no more right to kill or even wound the former aggressor (people vs albao 287 scra 129 ;people vs sambulan 239 scra 500 )withal a finding that there was no longer any unlawful aggression when the accused shot the victim rules out the possibility of selfdefense whether complete or incomplete (david vs court of appeals 290 scra 727 )just to be on the safe side accusedappellant embellishes his story by alleging that the victim after having been disarmed of the gun continued his aggression with a knife here now comes the second element of self defense for such posture to be properly appreciated there should be a necessity in both the action taken as well as in the means used and the latter depends on whether the aggressor himself was armed the nature and quality of the weapon used and the physical conditions and sizes of both the aggressor and the person defending himself (escoto vs ca 273 scra 752 )undoubtedly if it is true that the victim had a knife and accusedappellant had a gun his shooting the victim may not be justified as accusedappellant could not have been in any real danger of his life the knife was no match to the homemade handgun of accusedappellant and in fact there is no evidence that accusedappellant sustained any injuries evincive of an aggression which would justify his firing the gun to protect himself thus the shooting was unwarranted and was an unreasonable act of violence even as a means of defense under the circumstances moreover accusedappellant left his victim and did not even bother to report the matter to the proper authorities in this light the justifying circumstance of selfdefense may not survive in the face of accusedappellants flight from the crime scene and his failure to inform the authorities of the incident (people vs gerolaga 263 scra 143 )too no knife was found in the crime scene thus negating his tale of a second aggression all told the plea of selfdefense cannot be justifiably entertained where it is not only uncorroborated by any separate competent evidence but is also extremely doubtful in itself (jacobo vs ca 270 scra 270 )accusedappellant having failed to discharge the burden proving his defense his conviction shall of necessity follow on the basis of his admission to the killing accusedappellant argues that there was misappreciation of evidence since the judge who decided the case was not the one who heard the evidence for the prosecution we cannot ascribe merit to the argument since it is wellrecognized that the trial judges assessment of the credibility of a testimony is not to be anchored solely on how the witness conducted himself on the witness stand aside from the danger of being misled by appearance inherent in such a case a judge is supposed to render a decision on the basis of the evidence before him meaning the record and all the failure to be sure of the trial judge to have personally observed the prosecution witnesses manner and demeanor of testifying in no way affects the validity of the judgment rendered nor does ipso facto condemn the judgment erroneous more so where the same appears to be fully supported by the evidence on record as in the case at bar (people vs rayray 241 scra 1 )nonetheless while the court affirms the guilt of accusedappellant it is not persuaded that there was treachery which would qualify the killing of allan to murder treachery exists when the offender employs means methods or forms in the execution of the offense which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make (people vs sumalpong 284 scra 464 )in order for treachery to be taken as an aggravating circumstance there must be proof that accusedappellant had consciously adopted a mode of attack to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself (people vs quitlong 292 scra 360 )it should preliminarily be observed that both the prosecution and the defense witnesses are consistent in their assertions that accusedappellant and his companion bebot arrived in the crime scene at around 8 oclock in the evening; and that accusedappellant and his friend stayed on and conversed with the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita in the kitchen where allan and his father guillermo and one romulo percy were at that time it appears then that before accusedappellant shot the victim he had been there for about an hour during which time there had been an on going drinking spree for this reason the court finds it difficult to believe that allan guillermo spouses gonzalo and cornita one romulo percy and accusedappellant and companion were all in one and the same kitchen seated around in one and the same table and not talking to one another for about an hour the court perceives as odd and unnatural that while allan was seated alongside bebot and accusedappellant from 8 oclock to 9 oclock in the evening they did not engage in any sort of conversation or discussion even the testimony of guillermo that allan did not know accusedappellant and vice versa so that accusedappellant had to wait an hour to ask for the victims identity in order to kill him is doubtful it is of judicial notice that people in rural communities generally know each other both by face and name (people vs reynaldo 291 scra 701 )even the then 11yearold analyn claimed she knew accusedappellant (tsn dec 10 1997 p 4) making it doubly hard for the court to believe that accusedappellant and the victim did not know each other another point to consider is the testimony of analyn which narrated the incident in this wise q now when you heard the gunshot you were playing a we were already through playing we were already talking with each other in the sala q you talked with each other together with the children of dullana a yes sir (ibid p 12) x x x x x x x x x q meaning when salvador caguing and companion arrived they seated around the table together with your brother a yes sir q also your father a my father was in the improvised bed ""papag"" taking a rest q so while your brother was seated there in the table caguing bebot and duliana your father was resting in the papag a yes sir q because it was almost one hour after the arrival of these salvador caguing and companion when you heard the gunshot a that was already nine oclock when i heard the gunshot and salvador caguing shot my brother (ibid p 22) x x x x x x x x x q at eight oclock you were playing you were conversing a yes sir q and you did not mind the accused and bebot because you were conversing a yes sir they were conversing with other people inside the house (ibid p 21) so far as one can see it cannot be said that analyn witnessed how his brother allan was killed by accusedappellant admittedly she was unmindful of what was going on in the kitchen because she herself was conversing with her friends in the sala what caught her attention was the gunshot that she heard coming from the kitchen and she inferred that accusedappellant shot his brother allan further the testimony of guillermo and analyn are contradictory in relation to the physical position of guillermo at the time of the killing guillermo testified that he was likewise seated around the table on the other hand analyn said guillermo was taking a rest in the ""papag"" the general rule is that inconsistencies and contradictions in minor and trivial matter do not impair a witness credibility however the contradictory statements and omission of important details by the prosecution witnesses erode the credence of their testimony (people vs ortiz 266 scra 641 )the physical position of guillermo when the victim was killed by accusedappellant is one vital circumstance that would establish whether or not he had really seen how the accusedappellant shot the victim which will consequently prove the attendance of treachery in the killing of the victim the prosecution failed in this endeavor it must be stressed that treachery cannot be presumed it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself (people vs pe? 291 scra 606 )in treachery the mode of attack must have been sought of by the offender (people vs demonteverde 290 scra 175 )and the manner of attack must be proven; it cannot be presumed or concluded merely on the basis of the resulting crime (people vs asis 286 scra 64 )"
G.R. No. L-20911,Murder,2,"early in the morning of february 3 1958 rafael cabizares accompanied by his wife hospicia his brothers margarito and romualdo and his sons gumercindo marcelo casiano juan and lamberto left barrio cebuano headed for the poblacion of tupi cotabato bringing five sacks of corn loaded on a bull cart to be milled in tupi juan marcelo and lamberto who were all minors were then going to school upon approaching a hilly part they had to stop since the carabao could not pull the bull cart uphill rafael then requested his two brothers and his son gumercindo to accompany him up the hill and carry on their backs the sacks of corn with rafael leading the four proceeded uphill as the four approached sulpicio de la cernas house on top of the hill and were about to put down the sacks of corn appellant sulpicio who was in the house fired at and hit rafael who fell down sulpicio then ordered his companions to burn his house so that they would have an excuse meanwhile casiano gumercindo marcelo and romualdo brought the wounded rafael cabizares to the house of the latters father demetrio 100 meters away felisa bastismo rafaels mother ursula cabizares and segundino cabizares were there at the time after the group reached the house rafaels wounds were washed with hot water and then he was brought inside the third room of the house subsequently appellant sulpicio and the other accused arrived at the premises armed with firearms bolos and canes they stoned the house and trust their bolos thru the bamboo walls and flooring finding that there were women inside the house the accused ordered them to get out or else they would be killed also as felisa bastismo and ursula cabizares alighted from the besieged house marcelo cabizares followed them and although held by accused conrado pardillo and boxed by serapio maquiling he was able to escape to the nearby forest serapio maquiling then climbed up the window of the kitchen and with the carbine which he got from appellant sulpicio de la cerna shot at rafael cabizares who was sitting in the third room at this moment casiano cabizares jumped down from the house thru the kitchen door and ran away serapio maquiling followed him and shot the latter at the back killing him a few meters away from demetrios house appellant sulpicio de la cerna then got back the carbine climbed up the house and fired once more at rafael who was now lying down on the floor killing him finally thereafter the cadaver of casiano cabizares was tied to a bamboo pole carried by accused ramon alquizar and one wilfredo malias (at large) and placed near the burned house of sulpicio de la cerna as some of the accused followed while the rest proceeded to rafaels house the post mortem examinationconducted that very same day showed that casiano cabizares died from a gunshot wound the bullet entering the back and passing out in front while rafael cabizares sustained three gunshot wounds of entrance one gunshot exit wound and one stab wound dr bienvenido garcia the municipal health officer explained that the bullet which caused the first wound located in front at the left lower abdomen did not go thru at the back but split into two parts after entering the body however these two parts were already palpable on the left buttock of the decedent from which they were extracted the bullet which caused the second wound located directly at the back lodged in the 11th thoracic vertebra the third bullet entered near the left breast and went out at the right lumbar region the prosecution also presented proof that prior to the incident a land dispute arose between rafael and some of the accusedand that he had filed complaintswith the agrarian court against the latter the trial of which cases was scheduled on february 10 1958 appellants would have this court believe that they are innocent the four appellants convicted as accomplices insist they were never at the vicinity of the killing on the other hand appellant sulpicio de la cerna claims that both rafael and casiano were killed in selfdefense sulpicios version of what transpired is this in the morning of february 3 1958 guillermo esperanza and sulpicio de la cerna had just roasted corn in the latters house when rafael casiano and others all armed with bolos and canes arrived rafael demanded of sulpicio to come down for a confrontation the latters refusal to do so angered rafael who threw his cane at sulpicio and ordered his companions to surround the house thrust their bolos thru it and burn it because the house was on fire and fearing that he would be killed sulpicio alerted guillermo esperanza got his carbine and fired indiscriminately at his attackers to drive them away when rafael and casiano were hit their companions fled guillermo esperanza and sulpicio then got down from the burning house and left passing by the prostrate bodies of the decedents sulpicio proceeded to the house of one pedro esperanza to drink water and while there he saw a jeep coming loaded with policemen to whom be surrendered himself and his carbine expectedly guillermo esperanza gave the same version as abovenarrated said appellants version cannot be accepted the autopsy reports contradict sulpicios claim that he shot the decedents frontally while he was up in his house for both deceased each sustained a gunshot wound directly at the back moreover casianos wound of entry — located along the 12th rib — is lower than the wound of exit — located along the 6th rib— showing that the bullet flight path was upwards not downwards a gun fired from the elevated flooringof a house like sulpicios and aimed downwards could not have caused such wounds lastly rafaels cadaver bore a stab wound on the left side appellants version could not account for this while on the one hand nothing was found around the burned house of appellant sulpicio de la cerna such as the alleged cane thrown by rafael nor any other weapon or stones which may indicate agression or violence on the other bloodstains were found inside demetrio cabizares houseand also on the ground at the spot where according to the prosecutioncasiano fell when shot by serapio maquiling an empty carbine shell (exh i) was also found by dr garcia in the kitchen in this regard his testimony is not hearsay as appellant contends for although dr garcia did not personally pick it up he saw the empty shell taken from the floor and handed over to his companions before finally reaching himwhile casianos body was found near sulpicios burned house even appellants own witnessadmitted having found rafaels body inside demetrios house right after the incidents occurred appellants supposition that rafaels companions must have returned and carried away his body can hardly be accepted since there is no reason why they would not also bring back casianos body 1 romualdo cabizares — he was with his brother rafael when the latter was shot near sulpicios house and was among those who brought rafael to their fathers (demetrio) house 100 meters away he did not go up the house since he had to go back and evacuate his family to a forest 400 meters away having done so he went back and saw the incidents around demetrios house from a place covered with corn plants just 25 meters away this witness was able to observe the events around demetrios house even if the corn plants where he hid were sparse because of the 25meter distance from the accused whose attentions were focused on demetrios house and considering that he was in a hidden placewhile the accused were in the open field romualdo could see them without their noticing him it is true that the forest where romualdo took his family was 400 meters away but the accused took some time before they followed to demetrios house and romualdo ran back after hiding his family2 margarito cabizares — he was beside his brother rafael at the hill top when the latter was shot by sulpicio when he tried to hide near some banana clumps guillermo esperanza stabbed him hitting him near the left shoulder and causing him to fall unconscious shortly later when he recovered consciousness he followed rafael who was being brought to demetrios house but he was told by rafael to save himself so he went to a forest 400 meters away where he saw the goingson around demetrios house appellants state that nothing much can be gathered from his testimony however they overlook the obvious fact that margarito was an eyewitness to the shooting of rafael near sulpicios house although he lost consciousness after being stabbed it was momentary only the wound not being very seriousit was not impossible for him to have observed activities around demetrios house at a distance of 400 meters witness bonifacio barro corroborates him on this pointlastly he need not be a ballistics expert to recognize gunshot bursts 3 gumercindo cabizares — he was with his father rafael at the hill top he warned his father just before sulpicio fired the carbine after rafael was hit he helped carry him to demetrios house but did not stay there since he was told by rafael to go to dadiangas to call the pc 4 marcelo cabizares — he was near the bullcart downhill and when he heard gun shots he went uphill there he helped carry his father rafael to his grandfather demetrios house after the accused arrived in the latters house the women were ordered to get out he followed ursula cabizares and felisa bastismo on the way down but he was held by pardillo and boxed by serapio maquiling still he was able to escape 5 juan cabizares — he also stayed with the bullcart downhill and when he heard gun shots he went uphill and saw his father wounded he then followed behind the group carrying rafael to demetrios house and while inside the house saw the killing of rafael and casiano juan did not lie when he said his father was shot by sulpicio for altho he did not see the actual shooting he had good reasons to conclude that sulpicio fired the shot since he saw the latter shortly after the shooting holding the carbine which was still pointed at rafaelanyway his testimony on the point is merely corroborative of the others who were eyewitnesses he was able to identify serapio maquiling as the one who first shot his father in demetrios house although serapio was behind the bamboo partition since there were openings in it enabling one to see thru and he peeped thru itthe measurements in the third room (3 m x 4 m) are compatible with juans statement that sulpicio was 11/2 m away from rafael when the third shot was fired since sulpicio did not go inside the room but fired from the window outsidejuan was competent to testify on what occurred outside the house since he was also peeping thru the slits in the bamboo walls6 felisa bastismo — she was the mother of rafael cabizares she was with ursula cabizares and segundino cabizares inside demetrios house when the wounded rafael was brought in after rafaels wounds were washed felisa went down from the house with ursula as ordered by the accused and in the corn fields nearby she witnessed the killing of casiano 7 ursula and segundino cabizares — both were in demetrios house with felisa bastismo they saw the arrival of the accused and the stoning and thrusting of bolos thru the wallings one of the bolos wounded segundino cabizares on the left thigh ursula cabizares hid in a palay container but when they were ordered to get out she and felisa bastismo left and returned later in the afternoon while ursula was evidently mistaken when she said that margarito was also in the house the error is immaterial contrary to appellants contention she saw serapio maquiling on her way down the houseas to whether the other accused besides appellant antonio bautista were armed with bolos she stated she did not know since she only saw the bolo tips penetrating thru the wallingsher positive statement that she saw appellant godofredo rotor36 prevails of course over the negative testimony of maximo ca? appellants argue that since segundino cabizares was fearful he could not have been moving inside the besieged house of demetrio peeping every now and then thru the openings in the walls and observing the accused they seem to forget however that different people react differently even when apprehensive thus segundinos restlessness inside the house is neither unnatural or ridiculous to believe 8 bonifacio barro — he was with fiscal daproza and sgt paladin inside demetrios house a few days after february 3 1958 and upon orders of the fiscal he took out part of the flooring (exh k) the bamboo slatch (exhs l and l1) and the stones (exhs m m1 and m2) his statement that exhs m m1 and m2 were some of the stones fiscal daproza found on the roof of demetrios house corroborates the other prosecution witnesses who testified that the accused stoned the house he also stated that there were other stones inside the house corroborating romualdo cabizares9 dr bienvenido garcia — as municipal health officer he performed the autopsy on rafael and casiano cabizares on february 3 1958 he found casianos body near the burned house of sulpicio de la cerna and rafaels inside demetrios house in the latter house he also saw a bullet hole on the floor (exh j1) and a carbine shell (exh 1) appellants would cavil on dr garcias statement that he saw exh j (part of the flooring) only in court what he said however was that he saw it as cut already from the floor only in courthis statements as to the room dimensions (34 m x 45 m) and the distance of rafaels body to the partition (1 m or 2 ft) are approximations only and not exact measurementsa difference of a few insignificant meters is to be expected lastly his statements that the bullet hole (exhibit j1) was on the floor coincides with barros testimony that exh j was cut from the flooringthe portion of dr garcias testimonycited by appellants shows that rafael died after the third shot hit him — q after wound no 1 was inflicted is it possible that rafael cabizares was still alive a rafael cabizares was still alive q after inflicting wound no 2 is it possible that rafael cabizares was still alive a he was still alive q when wound no 3 was inflicted was he still alive by your conclusion a he was dead q what makes you conclude that he was already dead when wound no 3 was inflicted a because wound no 3 is mortal thus corroborating juan cabizares testimony that his father was still alive after the second shot wounded him although serapio got the carbine from sulpicio the latter cannot be considered a principal by indispensable cooperation or an accomplice there is no evidence at all that sulpicio was aware serapio would use the rifle to kill casiano presumably he gave the carbine to serapio for him to shoot rafael only as per their agreement neither is there concrete proof that sulpicio abetted the shooting of casiano sulpicio might have been liable if after the shooting of rafael serapio returned the carbine to him but upon seeing casiano fleeing immediately asked again for the carbine and sulpicio voluntarily gave it to him serapios criminal intention then would be reasonably apparent to sulpicio and the latters giving back of the rifle would constitute his assent thereto but such was not the case sulpicio therefore must be acquitted for the killing of casiano cabizares appellants godofredo rotor antonio bautista severino matchoca and teodoro libumfacil all put up alibi as their defense this the trial court rejected but it held them liable as accomplices only finding reasonable doubt on their guilt as coprincipals appellants would again advance their respective alibis here appellant rotor claims that at dawn on february 3 1957 he went alone to the spring in barrio cebuano to fetch water and after staying awhile there started back home on the way back his mother met him and told him not to go home because of an incident (the killing of the decedents) so he went instead to simeon navajas house and stayed there until february 18 1958 the prosecution however proved that in the early morning of february 3 1958 rotor was with maximo ca? fetching water in the spring on their way home they met appellants bautista and matchoca the latter gave rotor a carbine magazine with bullets saying ""here is the magazine of the bullets and give it to sulpicio de la

were able to recharge its batteries from a tractor that happened to pass by they continued the trip and finally arrived in the poblacion of tupi at about 800 am several months later while he was at

bullets recovered by dr africa from the body of the victim were fired from the same gun he identified the bullets as coming from a 38 caliber gunromeo reyes the brother of the victim alexander reyes testified that he personally knew antonio templo inasmuch as he was his childhood friend together with police officers he searched for the whereabouts of templo after the shooting incident they searched for templo in bataan and mindoro before they learned that he had fled to stay with his sister in the united states of americaon july 8 1992 the us authorities arrested templo for being an illegal alien at his sisters office in queens new york roosevelt avenue us templo denied the charge alleging that his name was richard barba when romeo reyes called templo by his nickname ""tony"" the latter looked at him and then remembered him inside his prison cell at the us immigration office templo approached romeo reyes and asked for forgivenesstemplo was eventually deported to the philippines on june 2 1993for his defense antonio templo testified that in the afternoon of september 11 1988 he drove her 13 year old daughter maria antoinette templo to the place of a certain mr vega who would type her daughters term paper upon reaching the corner of solis and katigbak streets his jeep was stopped by alexander reyes and then berated him ""putang ina mo bakit ganyan"" with a 38 caliber revolver reyes pistol whipped templo on the left side of his nape reyes told him to alight from his jeep after he alighted templos first reaction was to leave his daughter he ran to the crowd but suddenly stopped upon hearing two (2) gunshots reyes was not there anymore when templo went back he then drove the jeep to the place of mr vega he only found out from his brotherinlaw ramon ternate sr that alexander reyes was shot deadappellant denied challenging alexander reyes to a fight because according to him it would not look good in the presence of his daughtertemplo surmised that reyes pistolwhipped him because he did not pay the five thousand (p500000) peso membership fee in the gun club of the deceased he claimed that reyes had many enemies for the reason that he was a mischievous (""pilyo"") person for example he killed a helper of one rene gloria for disclosing his illegal activities he also had a rift with the del rio family two (2) of whose members were killedtemplo left the philippines together with his family to avoid the members of the new peoples army who used to visit his farm in batangashe denied any knowledge that a warrant of arrest was issued against him before he left the philippineshe denied having asked for forgiveness from romeo reyes after his arrest in new york for being an illegal alien during the deportation proceedings he filed an application for political asylum but it was deniedprosecution witnesses constantino and abogade positively identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime it was only about 530 oclock in the afternoon when they saw appellant shot the victim twice on the chest appellant followed the victim as the latter attempted to flee and in the process he (appellant) got close to prosecution witness constantino who was standing at the opposite side of the intersection where the shooting incident occurred this prosecution witness who positively identified appellant as the assailant of the victim did not waiver on crossexamination on the other hand appellants defense is a mere alibi he claims that before the gunshots were fired he left the crime scene and hid behind a jeep when he heard two (2) gunshots he went back to look for his daughter he denied shooting reyes for the reason that according to him he was not carrying a gun he even shifted the blame on reyes as the one who allegedly whipped him in the nape with a 38 caliber pistol when he returned to the place of shooting reyes was not there anymore so he drove his jeep to mr vegas place alibi is inherently weak for it is easy to contrive and concoct for such defense to prosper it is not enough for the accused to prove that he was somewhere else when the crime occurred he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crimein the case at bar it was established that appellant was just a few meters away from the crime scene it was not physically impossible for him to have committed the crime besides it is a wellsettled rule that when there are credible witnesses such as in the case at bench who have positively identified the assailant the defense of alibi is negative and selfserving and deserves no probative weightappellant contends that the affidavit of prosecution witness jovita constantino was taken twentytwo (22) days after the shooting incident occurred her account according to appellant was an afterthought to plug the gaps in the prosecution witness statements of john marfilla and anicia abogade appellant also contends that the testimony of jovita constantino was laden with inconsistencies he points out that constantino allegedly stayed in the factory up to 800 oclock in the afternoon while abogade testified that she was with constantino between 700 up to 800 oclock in the evening appellant also points out that constantino earlier denied knowing appellants name at the time of the shooting incident but later on admitted to have heard from her coworkers the appellants name as the one responsible for the crime these are minor inconsistencies that cannot override the prosecution witnesses positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime although there may be inconsistencies on minor details in her testimony the same do not impair constantinos credibility as a witness minor variances in the details of a witness account more frequently than not are badges of truth rather than indicia of falsehood and they often bolster the probative value of the testimonyappellant further contends that constantino and abogade are relatives and that they share the same middle name that is ""amande"" being relatives it was probable that they have compared notes apart from being a mere conclusion of fact on the part of appellant relationship assuming there is one will not by itself undermine the credibility of the said prosecution witnesses without showing improper motive for testifying against the appellant the absence of evidence showing any improper motive on the part of the said principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive exists and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credence"
G.R. No. L-19421,Murder,2,"this case involves a lessee of public forest land and a group of squatters evidence for the prosecution disclosed that romulo ramos is the lessee of 960 hectares of public forest land in the sitio of daeg barrio of bala municipality of bansalan davao subsequently he converted the leased land into a ranch on which he constructed the ranch houses for his cowhands one on the lower part of the ranch called ranch house no 1 and the other on the upper part thereof known as ranch house no 2 in the latter lived jose tirol roberto tirol julian daroy and the deceased doneza all cowhands of ramos at about ten oclock in the evening of december 13 1957; while the occupants of ranch house no 2 were asleep there came a succession of shots from the eastern side of the house awakened the cowhands took cover and laid flat on the floor not budging from their prone positions until early in the morning when they found one of their companions danilo doneza wounded near the left ear on that same morning of december 14 1957 doneza was brought to a certain dr villamin for treatment and thence to dr carlos in digos davao however due to the gravity of the wound he was finally taken to the brokenshire memorial hospital in davao city where he died on december 20 1957 in the meantime the municipal police of bansalan and the 72nd pc company stationed in davao city were informed of the incident immediately they proceeded to the ranch of ramos to investigate they found ranch house no 2 riddled with bullets and empty rifle shells scattered 30 to 50 meters away from the house in the farm of the appellant mauro bacang a poncho raincoat containing assorted paraphernalia including live ammunition and two enfield rifles was discovered in the house of celso lape was found another rifle pfc tuvilla of the 72nd pc company conducted an investigation with the exception of those of celso lape the appellants declarations were reduced to writing in their written statements they admitted participation in the attack on ranch house no 2 on the night of december 13 1957 these statements were subsequently signed and acknowledged by the appellants before special counsel roque m barnes of the office of the provincial fiscal of davao the case for the prosecution is anchored mainly on the extrajudicial confessions made by the appellants with the exception of agripino fontanosa who did not make any confession teodosio umpok who was not apprehended and is still at large and celso lape whose verbal confession was not reduced to writing the appellants signed written statements relating in great detail their participation in the attack on ranch house no 2 these statements disclose that at about four oclock in the afternoon of december 13 1957 agripino fontanosa went to the house of mauro bacang at sitio laya tacul bansalan davao to persuade the latter and the other appellants who were then staying with him (ie silverio ca?te aquiline bacang genovevo barro macario matas and crispulo gilvero) to attack ranch house no 2 that evening; that the appellants acceded to the proposal although they initially objected after having been promised land of their own should they be successful in their mission; that after supper that evening the aforementioned appellants left the house of bacang to carry out their criminal plan; that mauro bacang and silverio ca?te were armed with long barreled guns while the rest carried bolos; that they dropped by the house of agripino fontanosa to inform him that they were already on their way; that they met teodosio umpok in the house of fontanosa armed with a carbine furnished by the latter; that thereafter they picked up martin cabardo alfredo cabardo and celso lape who were to guide them to the ranch house and to their places of deployment; that upon arrival in the vicinity of ranch house no 2 the defendants deployed themselves and mauro bacang silverio ca?te teodosio umpok and celso lape started firing at it; that the whole episode took place between eleven oclock and twelve midnight with the gunfire lasting for about thirty minutes that after the shooting they dispersed the group of mauro bacang stopping by fontanosas place once more to inform the latter of the outcome of their mission; that teodosio umpok returned the carbine of fontanosa while mauro bacang hid his gun and that of silverio ca?te upon arrival at the formers house while admitting the authenticity of their signatures on the extrajudicial confessions the appellants deny their voluntariness and veracity alleging that they were procured through force violence duress and intimidation specifically they testified that the pc soldiers under capt bucoy of the 72nd pc company maltreated them inflicting bruises contusions and wounds on their bodies as proof of the injuries they sustained they presented medical certificates made out by dr marcial s santos and dr dominador f mendoza of the davao general hospital this pretense of the appellants does not deserve belief except for the medical certificates issued to genovevo barro and crispulo gilvero which attest to the presence of unhealed wounds on their bodies the rest merely reveal findings of scars abrasions discolorations and complaints of pain the appellants claim that this was because the medical examination was conducted only on january 6 1958 or eighteen days after their confinement in the pc barracks at davao city where the alleged maltreatment took place note must however be taken of the fact that the counsel for the accused in the lower court had seen these wounds as early as december 23 1957 nevertheless they were not brought to the immediate attention of a physician for proper examination as the lower court observed in its decision if the accused were still suffering from injuries and the injuries were visible on their bodies on december 23 1957 when their lawyer atty buagas saw them at the provincial wardens office there was no sufficient reason why atty buagas did not at once or the next day took (sic) them to the hospital for medical examination the excuse that there was lack of guards at the provincial jail is not convincing even granting arguendo that there was lack of guards and no definite time could be ascertained as to when a guard could be available atty buagas would have taken a doctor to the provincial jail to examine physically the accused before the injuries healed atty buagas would not wait until january 6 1958 considering that the accused told him that they were forced to make confessions when the accused were finally examined on january 6 1958 they were able to show only healed wounds scratches or mere complaints of pain which a doctor can not verify as for the wound of genovevo barro described in his medical certificate as ""contusion xyphoid process"" the examining physician testified on crossexamination by the fiscal that it was apparently inflicted only three days before his physical examination a similar disclosure was made with respect to the unhealed wound of crispulo gilvero the said wound described as ""partially healed multiple posterior elbow joint right"" must have been caused five or six days only prior to the doctors examination further testimony by the examining physicians brought out the fact that the appellants scars and wounds are of a superficial nature and could have been selfinflicted the appellants claim that they were coerced intimidated and browbeaten into affixing their thumbmarks and signatures on their extrajudicial confessions before special counsel roque m barnes of the provincial fiscals office is belied by the evidence on record fiscal barnes testified that after the pc soldiers brought the accused to his office they left the room at his request leaving him alone with the accused; that jose c adao a clerk of his office translated the contents of the affidavits into visayan which is understood by all the accused; that the latter affirmed the truth of their declarations; that he asked the accused if they had anything more to add to their written statements and they answered in the negative; that they voluntarily affixed their signatures and thumbmarks to their respective affidavits after which he received their oaths; and that he did not see or notice any injuries or signs of maltreatment on the bodies of the accused when they were brought to him adao corroborated the foregoing testimony he declared that a pc soldier brought the accused to the fiscals office sometime in december 1957; that he translated the contents of the affidavits into the visayan dialect; that the affiants voluntarily signed their respective written declarations in his presence; and that he did not see or notice any injuries on the bodies of the accused the constabulary officers and soldiers were no less categorical in their denial of the appellants claim of maltreatment capt antonio a bucoy head of the squad that was sent to investigate the shooting in daeg testified on rebuttal that he did not order the accused exposed to the sun or in any way maltreated likewise pfc tuvilla pc investigator testified that he did not lay hands on the appellants and neither did he threaten to illtreat them if they did not sign their respective affidavits other pc soldiers namely benigno ordinaria clemente layaguin generoso espantaleon and cesar buit corroborated the testimony of pfc tuvilla moreover the testimony of lorenzo ozam a guard at the davao provincial jail militates against the appellants allegation of having been subjected to thirddegree methods he related that he saw the appellants when they were admitted to the provincial jail on december 23 1957 but he did not see any injuries on their faces and bodies after they removed their clothes for inspection the appellants assail the veracity of the extrajudicial confessions by putting up the defense of alibi the evidence for mauro bacang silverio ca?te crispulo gilvero genovevo barro and aquilino bacang tended to establish their presence in pikit cotabato on the night of december 13 1957 macario matas on the other hand was allegedly in the house of a certain remegio diana a school teacher residing at padada davao on that fateful night a similar defense was raised by alfonso and martin cabardo who tried to show they were in their house in upper patolangon a part of milang cotabato and celso lape who asserted that he was in his farm at dapok milang cotabato when the incident at the ramos ranch happened after a careful examination and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence on hand we find that the appellants defense of alibi lacks that plausibility sufficient to convince us of their innocence bearing in mind the oftrepeated ruling of this court that alibi is a weak defense for it is easy to manufacture (people vs padilla 48 phil 718 731; people vs de asis 61 phil 384 389; people vs japitana and santos 77 phil 175 180; people vs estacio gr no l11430 january 30 1960) and considering too the existence of the extrajudicial confessions which on their faces and as corroborated by other evidence bespeak the true sequence of events we find the appellants evidence profferred to shore up their defense of alibi not convincing the alibi of mauro bacang and his aforementioned companions finds apparent support in the testimony of roque dandan a preacher of the united church of christ in the philippines who testified that mauro bacang and his friends dropped at his house at karapulo bansalan davao on december 7 1957 on their way to pikit cotabato and again on december 14 1957 on their way home from pikit as proof thereof he presented a notebook (exh bb) which contains a list of the persons who ate in his house on various occasions a close and careful examination of the notebook and its contents however fails to give credence to his testimony it is an old composition notebook with frayed edges the first eight pages of which contain references to biblical passages and what appears to be notes on proposed sermon the socalled list of visitors who ate in his house starts on the bottom third of the eighth page with the entry of august 2 to 5 1956 and ends on the last line of the next page with the entry of december 5 1958 except for the last two pages the rest of the notebook is blank mauro bacang and his friends are listed down as visitors on december 7 and 14 1957 while the former alone is listed down on december 16 and 18 1957 the notebook acquires significance because of the fact that its existence was brought out only on crossexamination by the fiscal it was produced in evidence only after dandan was asked to bring it to court if the entries therein were accepted as true then bacangs alibi assumes an aura of credibility however this court cannot rely on this piece of evidence while the entries were written in pencil and supposedly at various dates yet there appears no variation in the strokes nor in the shading of the pencil lines furthermore while the list of visitors is written in pencil the rest of the notations and entries in the notebook are in ink moreover the circumstance under which this notebook was produced is a bit puzzling considering that dandan is a principal witness for the defense and that all along he had been in possession of this important piece of evidence isnt it strange that he should make known its existence only after the prosecution began asking him why he would remember his dates so well wouldnt it be more logical to expect the defense to present this evidence on direct examination considering that dandan is their witness we have examined the record on this point and our doubts have not been erased by the witness answers to the probing questions of the lower court consequently we find ourselves with the court a quo in disbelieving dandans testimony neither can we accord credit to the testimony of the other witnesses for mauro bacang vicente fontanosa who was contacted allegedly by bacang in pikit and who testified that the latter was with him on the night of december 13 1957 at elys cafe is the son of agripino fontanosa one of the accused and the counsel for the squatters on the ranch of ramos elena fontilla the owner of elys cafe in pikit remembers too much for a a woman who keeps a refreshment parlor frequented by numerous persons she remembers the dates of events long past and of no moment at all when they happened — feats of memory equally displayed by the other witnesses for bacang and his companions coincidence too seems to play an important role in the defense of bacang odon romeros testimony that mauro bacang and his friends were with him it elys cafe on the night of december 13 1957 celebrating the death anniversary of his father does not deserve serious consideration as the lower court observed it was a strange coincidence that odon romero happened to be in the house of vicente fontanosa when mauro bacang and his companions went there and that odon romero celebrated the death anniversary of his father on december 13 1957 at elys cafe and mauro bacang and his inseparable companions looked for vicente fontanosa found him at elys cafe and were invited by odon romero to join in the celebration as for the alibi of macario matas we find that it is supported only by the testimony of remegio diana who is his brotherinlaw and by rosaleo nadela who admitted that he was reminded only by diana of the date when he met matas ie december 13 1957 celso lapes alibi was not corroborated by any witness the same is true with the alibi of martin cabardo in the case of alfredo cabardo only the testimony of his father julio cabardo corroborates his alibi these testimonies are inadequate to support the defense of alibi which must be proved by ""positive clear and satisfactory evidence"" (us vs olais 36 phil 828 829) the defense attempts to dilute the strength of the prosecutions case by picturing it as one huge conspiracy among the constabulary soldier the provincial fiscals office and romulo ramos against the eleven accused the strands in this supposed web of intrigue and machinations are formed by evidence for the defense that the wound sustained by danilo doneza was caused not by a bullet but by protruding nail which pierced doneza near the left ear as he sought cover during the shooting; by assertions that doneza died of cover respiratory complications and not as a result of a gunshot wound; by the testimony of hardly credible witnesses identifying the rifles marked as exhibits c d and j as belonging not to the accused but to the cowboys of ramos; by the insinuation of crispiniano jorgio one of the defense witnesses that those who fired at ranch house no 2 were ilocanos and moros based on his having allegedly heard and seen several persons pass near his house after the shooting speaking in ilocano and wearing hats and turbans; and by the attempt to establish as a fact that ramos bribed the pc to implicate the accused in the killing of danilo doneza unfortunately for the appellants the web they constructed cannot bear the weight of the prosecutions evidence dr asuncion paraan who performed the autopsy on the body of doneza twentyfour hours after his death testified that she found an external wound below the left ear lobe ""possibly an entrance wound of a gunshot"" the bullet (which was never found on autopsy) traveled six inches into the neck fracturing the cervical vertebrae and resulting in the severance of the spinal cord which was the immediate cause of death the appellants contention that doneza died because of respiratory complications is hardly supported by the evidence on hand "

declared that he was the desk sergeant on duty when cleofe reported the shooting incident at the liloan police station he entered ""author unknown person"" in the police blotter since he could not establish after interrogating cleofe who jacintos assailant wason crossexamination patrolman necostrato clarified that he placed said entry since cleofe told him that jacinto was ""shot by a person whom she did not know and identify""jeovani son of jacinto and moisesa testified that his sister ""was inside the fence of (their) house shouting"" when their father was shot he on the other hand ran to the side of the house and hid behind a stone when the assailant left he went outside the fence and saw his father ""lying down"" however he did not see any motorcycle in fact he could not see anything because ""it was dark"" and ""the light on the post was not lighted""on crossexamination jeovani admitted that his sister was nearer the gunman than he was since she was ""immediately behind (their) father when he was shot""after the defense presented its evidenceinchief the prosecution recalled cleofe to the witness stand as rebuttal witness cleofe testified that oscar was not arrested at the liloan police station when he ostentatiously submitted himself for interrogation ""so that a surveillance (could) be made on his person"" and the real killer knownoscar however argues in his appellant’s brief that cleofe could not have recognized him as the driver of the motorcycle during the five (5) seconds that she claimed to have glanced at him and the gunman while fleeing oscar claims that (1) cleofe’s view of the driver was obstructed by the gunman who boarded the motorcycle behind the driver; (2) cleofe was facing the backs of the driver and the gunman as they sped off towards cebu city; and that (3) there was no light from the lamppost he cited cleofe’s testimony as follows atty alo q my question is when you saw the motorcycle for a period of five (5) seconds the situation in the motorcycle was that the rider was there already behind the driver a yes he was already there q now the motorcycle when you saw it for five (5) seconds was already facing towards cebu city a yes q and there was a motion already the engine was started a yes q and you notice(d) it only when the rider sat at the back that is the time you saw the motorcycle a i saw him when he rode the motorcycle when the motorcycle was runningoscar further maintains that witness could not have recognized at that time because the assailant and the driver were facing against her which means that cleofe pepito could not have had a glimpse of the drivers face because he was covered by the trigger man who was then seated at the back of the driver of the motorcycle cleofe however testified that atty alo q but you must remember that at 830 o clock in the evening it is already night (sic) it is (sic) already very dark is that correct a yes q and because of that even you who is very young can make a mistake of looking at the light that comes across the street towards a person is that correct a i was not mistaken in that because i am so familiar with his face i can recognize him even when his back is turned (witness saying that at the same time pointing to the accused)in fact cleofe confirmed that everything that happened that fateful evening of 26 october 1991 was captured like a ""photograph (in) her mind""as to the allegation that there was no light at the lamppost a review of the transcript of stenographic notes reveals that cleofe testified that the place where oscar waited with his motorcycle was lighted by a ""mercury"" bulb from the vulcanizing shop of arnold hernandez she elaborated atty alo do you recall having made an affidavit in connection with your investigation before the fiscals office a i remember having executed an affidavit at the police station at the ramos supermarket q now you remember what you have stated in your affidavit court answer the question can you still recall what you stated a yes atty alo q now on this important question of identity could you recall if you stated in that affidavit that the light from the vulcanizing shop was the light that caused you to see the motorcycle and the driver a that was not the only light the light coming from the vulcanizing shop was not the only source of light at that time there was a motorcycle vehicle coming or passing by at that time q now you said that it was the light of arnold hernandezs shop that lighted the motorcycle and the driver when you saw the driver do you recall that a yes q that is why you made the statement that the light of the vulcanizing plant was the one that lighted the motorcycle is that correct a it was one of the sources of the lightcross examination by atty alo q going back to the subject matter of light you mentioned that there was a light coming from the vulcanizing plant of arnold hernandez this light of arnold is in his shop a yes q while the motorcycle is across the road a yes q so the light involves only a bulb a mercury q and it is under the roof of his house a inside the vulcanizing there is a light but there are also lights in post(s) around the shop q you describe the light what was that again a mercury q similar to the (sic) used by the visayan electric company in the post(s) here in cebu city a no sir q you mean to say the light of the visayan electric is much brighter (than) the one used by arnold a the light in the post of the shop of arnold is brighter than the visayan electric q now when you were outside your gate could you tell us how fast was that car passed (sic) the motorcycle during that time a natural q that car was going to the north or to the south a to the north q meaning to say it was proceed(ing) to danao a yes q and it was timely when you looked at the motorcycle that car was passing alighted (sic) to (sic) the motorcycle is that correct a yes q the lights of the car hit the motorcycle directly is that correct a it was lightedthe following circumstances based chiefly on jose pepitos testimonywere established by the state 1 jose pepito saw oscar and a companion drinking beer at myrnas store at bo pitogo consolacion cebu in the evening of 26 october 1991 and then leaving towards pagutlan yati liloan on board a motorcycle 2 several minutes later an unidentified man shot jacinto at the gate of his mothers house in pagutlan yati liloan cebu 3 on the road to pagutlan jose pepito heard the shot after which he saw a man run to the other side of the road where another man waited on a motorcycle as soon as the gunman boarded the duo fled 4 jose pepito observed that the men and the motorcycle he had seen at myrnas store were the same persons and motorcycle he saw near arnold hernandezs vulcanizing shop immediately prior and after the shooting pepito saw the gunman and oscar flee on board the motorcycle 5 jose pepito positively identified oscar as the driver of the motorcycle it is also stressed that cleofe reported the shooting incident at the liloan police station some thirty minutes after her declaration disclaiming knowledge of the name of jacinto’s assailant was not inconsistent with her belated claim that oscar was the driver of the getaway motorcycle cleofe’s alleged omission is more or less attributable to the fact that her interrogation at the liloan police station centered on the identity of the gunman not on the driver of the motorcycle in any event she testified that she mentioned oscar as the companion of the gunman when she first reported the shooting incident but was uncertain whether her statement was entered in the (police) blotter "

(2) it was possible that more than one person inflicted the injuries; and (3) it was probable that a small bolo and a fan knife were used to inflict the injuries the victims father rosendo tonog testified to the expenses incurred for his sons funeral and to the fact that the latter had been supporting him from wages earned as a mason in manila the defense presented a different version of the event aliposa asserted on the witness stand that it was he alone who had stabbed sonny; that he had done so in selfdefense and that crispin velarde was not with him at the time he declared that although he and his friends (ie crispin velarde paterno gallano gader delorino) arrived at the fair at almost the same time they had immediately gone their separate ways to watch their favorite games and activities aliposa claims he was alone watching one of the games when a commotion occurred about nine (9) meters away he saw people scurrying out of the way of sonny tonog who was chasing one pc maizo later as he was about to leave the fair grounds sonny tonog confronted him and asked him if he was pc maizos companion which he denied whereupon sonny had attacked him with a batangas ""29"" (presented by the prosecution as exh ""b"") he had been hit ""on the left side of his chest towards the armpit"" the thrust tearing the blue jacket he was wearing then backing away from his attacker sonny had tripped on a low wooden fence and fallen to the ground face up sonny tried to stab him again but he managed to evade the lunging thrust and pin sonnys arm with his left on gaining this momentary advantage he had quickly pulled out with his right hand a small bolo or depang (which the prosecution presented as exhibit a) and thrust it thrice into sonnys body he had then pushed sonny away and run to the house of his friend crispin velarde who let him in the velarde family was then having dinner aliposa told them he wanted to surrender to police lt velarde because he had stabbed someone at the fair lt velarde replied ""wait;

G.R. No. 137604,Homicide,1,"during the trial the prosecution and the defense agreed to adopt the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses estelita latoja and dr cristina preyra given during the separate trial of silva and gulane4 subject to additional questions on direct examination and full crossexaminationbased on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses the trial court culled the following facts ""on december 21 1995 at about 500 oclock in the morning near the immaculate memorial park in bagong silang navotas metro manila estelita latoja gave her son leo who was already on board a tricycle on his way to work transportation money having done so estelita took about two steps on her way back home it did not take long when she heard a gunshot estelita who was then only about a meter away from leo saw silva who was with two other companions named araneta and gulane holding a gun still directed at leo estelita shouted to silva ""huwag huwag anak ko iyan"" leo on the other hand said to silva ""huwag hindi tayo magkatalo"" leos wife shirley who was present at that time was not able to say or do anything estelita approached silva who hit her at the left side of the head as he pushed her aside and thereafter fired his gun to (sic) leo estelita added that gulane was also armed with a gun and that he fired about four shots at leo who was hit thereby araneta also fired his gun at leo thereafter the three fled""the accusedappellants claim that estelita was not a credible witness and that her testimony suffers from incredibility deserves scant consideration we have carefully gone over the records and find nothing in her account of the events that would show that her testimony was not credible on the contrary estelita made a clear narration of the shooting of her son in her testimony according to estelita at around 500 am of december 21 1995 a coworker of her son leo latoja (leo) went to their house to ask for transportation money for leo who left their house earlier that morning leo could not ask for the money himself since he was avoiding his oneyearold child who would always insist on going with him leos wife shirley then proceeded to leo who was waiting inside a tricycle parked some two hundred (200) meters away from their house shirley however failed to give leo the money since she forgot her purse leo instead asked estelita who happened to follow shirley to the place where leo was for the money after giving leo some money estelita turned her back from leo and had proceeded to take two (2) steps away from him when she suddenly heard a gunshot she turned her head and saw silva accompanied by two armed men whom she later identified as gulane and the accusedappellant poking a gun at her son upon seeing this she yelled at silva ""wag wag anak ko yan"" while leo beged ""wag di tayo talo"" thereafter estelita approached silva in order to defend her son but the latter hit her on the head and pushed her aside silva gulane and the accusedappellant continued to shoot leo who was now sprawled on the pavement oozing with blood then the three fled the scene using a small alleydr rosaline cosidon who performed the autopsy on the body of the victim testified that the victim died of multiple gunshot woundsestelita positively identified the accusedappellant and pointed to him as one of her sons assailants as follows ""fiscal acu? madam witness in your testimony before this court during the trial of accused gerry silva you testified that on december 21 1995 at 500 oclock in the morning near the immaculate memorial park located at bagong silang navotas metro manila you saw not only gerry silva but also alex gulane and gilbert araneta shot to death your son repeatedly and i am referring to your son leo latoja now the question is if you see gilbert araneta again will you be able to identify him a yes sir i know him q will you please look around this courtroom and point out to us gilbert araneta if you see him inside interpreter (witness pointing to a person who was asked to stand up and when asked his name he answered robert araneta) fiscal acu? why are you sure that it was this person gilbert araneta who announced his name as not gilbert but robert araneta as one of the companions of gerry silva in shooting to death your son leo latoja a i have known him for a long time q and how long have you known you said you have known robert aka gilbert araneta for a long time can you give us a number of years how many a five years fiscal acu? thats all with the witness""the accusedappellants claim that estelita was mistaken in naming him as ""gilbert araneta"" and not ""robert araneta"" does not destroy her credibility and is not sufficient to exculpate him for even assuming that the accusedappellants real name is robert it is sufficient that she was positive as to his physical identity as a participant in the shooting of her son from her own personal knowledge for purposes of identifying him in the present casefurthermore this court has ruled on countless occasions that the trial court is in the best position to determine facts and to assess the credibility of witnesses as it is in a unique position to observe the witnesses deportment while testifying which opportunity the appellate court is denied on appeal; this court will respect the findings and conclusions of the trial court provided that they are supported by substantial evidence on recordin the case at bar we find no cogent reason to disturb the trial courts appreciation of the evidence and find no basis therein to rule that estelitas testimony was not credible besides the appellant has failed to prove any improper motive on the part of estelita to falsely impute such a terrible crime to herein accusedappellant the testimony of a single witness when credible and trustworthy is sufficient to convict and must be given ful! faith and credence when no reason to falsely testify is showngiven the positive identification made by the lone prosecution witness the accusedappellants uncorroborated defense of denial and alibi must fail the defense of alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to contrive and difficult to provea positive identification of the accused made by an eyewitness prevails over such a defenselikewise the denial of accusedappellant cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the prosecution witnesses that he participated in the commission of the crime like the defense of alibi a denial is inherently weak and crumbles in the light of positive declarations of truthful witnesses who testified on affirmative matters that the accusedappellant was at the scene of the incident and was one of the victims assailants and perpetrator of the crimewe now come to the imposition of the proper penalty considering that the participation of the accusedappellant in the killing of leo latoja has been proven beyond reasonable doubt and considering further that the convictions of his coaccused silva and gulane have been sustained by this court in people vs silvawe adopt the finding in said case that homicide was committed as well as the imposition of penalty therein the courts ratiocination regarding the absence of treachery and evident premeditation is in point as follows ""the trial court reasoned that the killing was attended by treachery because the suddenness of the attack caught leo offguard thus preventing him from putting up any defense we ruled in a litany of cases that treachery cannot be presumed; it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself the same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before treachery may be considered either as an aggravating or qualifying circumstance further treachery must be based on some positive conclusive proof and not only upon hypothetical facts or on mere suppositions or presumptions the trial court erred when it presumed that the killing was qualified by treachery although the record shows that the witness did not see the commencement of the assault estelita testified that she noticed accusedappellants only after she heard the first shot q madam witness you mentioned that your son immediately before the shooting incident was with his wife a yes sir q and while your son was with his wife in the tricycle or pedicab do you know where the accused then a no sir q in what stage of the incident when you first noticed silva a upon hearing the first shot q what about gulane a i saw them together q how about gilbert a the three were together q so in other words you first noticed them when you heard the first shot a yes sir q and do i get it right from you that you have not seen them prior to the first shot a no sir in her earlier testimony estelita explained that it was the first shot that prompted her to turn her head and it was only then that she saw gerry silva pointing his gun at her son who was already bloodied these statements are fraught with possibilities nagging doubts would crop up as to how the three (3) assailants started the assault considering that there was an interval of time from the moment estelitas back was towards leo until she heard the first shot before that she did not notice the presence of accusedappellants one can argue that between the time when estelitas back was turned from the victim after she had taken about two (2) steps away and the first shot there was a lapse of more or less four (4) seconds no other logical conclusion then could be drawn but that the attack was sudden and unexpected but this is not that simple where all indicia tend to support the conclusion that the attack was sudden and unexpected but there are no precise data on this point treachery cannot be taken into account it can in no way be established from mere suppositions drawn from the circumstances prior to the moment of the aggression that the accused perpetrated the killing with treachery "
G.R. No. L-23514,Murder,2,the prosecution relying mainly on the testimony of two eyewitnesses — celestino atun and percival amador — and of the policemen who went to the scene of the crime upon noticing the commotion it produced sought to establish the following between 100 and 200 oclock in the afternoon of march 27 1962 some persons had a quarrel inside the new bicol carinderia an eatery located near the legaspi port market legaspi city after a short while the protagonists came out through the backdoor of the carinderia jose manansala had rodrigo in a tight embrace from behind with his arms under the latters armpits while rodrigo was in that position of apparent helplessness avelino stabbed him with a balisong or batangas knife the stabbing continued while rodrigo was led or dragged by jose to a bamboo bed (papag) nearby and even after rodrigo had been forced down on it in a prone position when the policemen who responded to the commotion arrived they found avelino still holding the fatal weapon and rodrigos limp body bathed in his own blood stretched on the papag a taxicab was commandeered to take the wounded man to a hospital but he expired even before the vehicle could start the autopsy later conducted by dr antolin lotivio a resident physician of the albay provincial hospital revealed that the victim died from massive hemorrhage and shock as a result of the multiple wounds (thirteen in all) sustained by him in the chest abdomen back and the extremities the accused did not take the witness stand however they presented two witnesses domingo daria and salvador petilos who said that they saw the whole incident the substance of their testimony is as follows early in the afternoon of march 27 1962 avelino a smalltime peddler of textiles in the legaspi port market was eating his lunch inside one of the eateries dotting the market site when rodrigo aringo alias diego a baggage boy in the same market approached him and demanded his fee for having carried avelinos baggage avelino said he was willing to pay for the services rendered at noon but not for those rendered earlier in the morning he then took some money from his pocket and proferred it to rodrigo obviously peeved at having been thus publicly rebuffed rodrigo brusquely brushed avelinos hand aside and instantly gave him a fist blow in the face avelino fell from his seat; he tried to get up but was given another blow and then a third as he reeled from the force of the last blow a batangas knife he was carrying fell from his trousers pocket avelino picked up the knife and rodrigo seeing that he was armed rushed to the carinderias kitchen and returned almost immediately with a 10inch knife in his hand with it he swung at his antagonist but the latter evaded the blow meanwhile appellant jose manansala an uncle of avelino noticed the commotion from outside the carinderia where he was loading baggage on a parked truck some six meters away he shouted at rodrigo to stop rodrigo paid no heed and instead delivered another thrust at avelino who again evaded it at the third attempt jose embraced rodrigo from behind and it was at that moment that avelino stabbed rodrigo and inflicted the numerous wounds which proved fatal jose took the kitchen knife from rodrigo and threw it away and then released his limp body on the papag nearby when the policemen arrived avelino was still clutching the knife he had used both appellants were apprehended appellants plea is selfdefense this is predicated on the theory that the deceased was himself armed with a knife with which he tried to stab avelino as declared by the two witnesses for the defense several circumstances however belie this claim first avelino sustained no knife wound at all second although several policemen arrived at the scene of the incident almost immediately after it happened not one of them saw the knife allegedly used by rodrigo nor was it shown to them or at least brought to their attention by either of the appellants indeed when avelino surrendered to the policemen he declined to give any statement which in the natural course of things he would have done if he had acted merely to defend himself a protestation of innocence or justification is the logical and spontaneous reaction of a man who finds himself in such an inculpatory predicament as that in which the policemen came upon the appellants with avelino still clutching the death weapon and his victim dying before him but while it is clear that avelino did not act in legitimate selfdefense the trial court correctly held that there was sufficient provocation on the part of the victim the evidence given by the witnesses for the defense as to how and why the fight started and as to the fact that the deceased hit avelino with his fist is not controverted by the witnesses for the prosecution who did not see the incident from the very beginning and one fist blow at least is confirmed by the doctor who treated avelino for a contusion around one eye jose manansala was found guilty as coprincipal on the ground that there was concert of action between him and his nephew the evidence does not justify this finding beyond reasonable doubt there is no showing that the killing was agreed upon between them beforehand no motive for it has been shown other than the provocation given by the deceased; and such motive was true only insofar as avelino was concerned the circumstances indicate that if jose embraced rodrigo and rendered him helpless it was to stop him from further hitting avelino with his fists however jose is not entirely free from liability for it has been established that even after the first knife thrust had been delivered he did not try to stop avelino either by word or overt act instead jose continued to hold rodrigo even forced him down on the bamboo bed with avelino still pressing the attack withal it cannot be said that joses cooperation was such that without it the offense would not have been accomplished but although not indispensable it was a contributing factor if joses initial intent was free from guilt it became tainted after he saw the first knife thrust delivered the thirteen wounds must have taken an appreciable interval of time to inflict and joses cooperation facilitated their infliction he must therefore be held liable as an accomplice

G.R. No. 132632,Homicide,1,"ambrocio and anacita benedicto owned a sarisari store in their house in marigold subdivision san jose del monte bulacan according to anacita at around 630 in the evening of february 7 1996 appellant angel rios a neighbor hurled stones at their house a few minutes later and while the benedicto spouses were tending their store appellant bought cigarettes ambrocio confronted appellant about the stoning incident and an altercation ensued between them as the two engaged in a verbal tussle joselino mesa and his fellow barangay tanods named amorsolo dayao rivera and espino who were roving the vicinity chanced upon the disputants having heard the appellant shout at ambrocio mesa intervened and requested the two to part ways he even escorted them to their respective residences a few minutes later appellant went back to the store just then anacita saw her husband go to the terrace of their house appellant suddenly approached ambrocio and stabbed his right stomach anacita was only a meter away from the antagonists; she was facing her husbands back while appellant was standing in front of ambrocio as anacita started shouting appellant fled mesa and his group saw anacita weeping while ambrocio was lying lifeless in the terrace of their house anacita told the tanods that appellant had stabbed her husband one of the tanods assisted ambrocio but the latter succumbed to death even before they could reach the hospital the postmortem certificate of death shows that ambrocio died of ""shock due to a stab wound at the chest around 3 cm penetrating the right auricle (heart)"" mesa and his companions arrested appellant in his brothers house thirty (30) minutes after the crime happened the following day anacita and mesa executed sworn statements before the police with only appellant testifying the defense interposed alibi appellant a 39yearold laborer from san fernando romblon who had been staying for two decades with his brother in graceville marilao bulacan had reported to his job in san jose del monte bulacan at 700 am of february 7 1996 he stopped working at 500 pm and returned to his brothers house reaching it at around 800 pm moments later joselino mesa accompanied by some barangays tanods arrived and brought him to the municipal hall of san jose del monte they did not inform him that he was a suspect in the killing of ambrocio benedicto appellant knew ambrocio because they had built a house near the benedictos residence and it was from the latters store that they would buy their cooking needs he denied having seen amborcio on that fateful day of february 7 1996 no cogent reason exists to overturn the trial courts assessment that anacita benedicto positively and unequivocally identified appellant as the felon who stabbed her husband it is doctrinal that the trial courts evaluation of the credibility of a testimony is accorded the highest respect for the trial court has an untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and thus to determine whether he or she is telling the truth anacitas testimony on the matter clearly supports the trial courts finding on the matter thus fiscal q — where is this ambrocio benedicto your husband now a — hes already dead q — tell us what is the cause of death of your husband a — he was stabbed q — by whom madam witness a — by angel rios fiscal q — madam witness if angel rios is around in this courtroom will you be able to identify him witness a — yes sir fiscal will you please stand up and look around and point him to us (witness pointed to man in yellow shirt who gave the name of angel rios) court q — why do you say that it was angel rios who stabbed your husband a — because i saw him fiscal q — when was your husband stabbed by angel rios a — he was stabbed on february 7 1996 court q — at what time a — more or less 800 in the evening fiscal q — where a — in the terrace of our house q — where is your house located a — in muzon san jose del monte bulacan (emphasis supplied) there is no doubt therefore that anacita had a good look at her husbands assailant and that she actually saw appellant stab ambrocio as she was only a meter away from them behind her husband who was facing appellant she could not have mistaken another man for appellant because being neighbors he was familiar to her aside from being her neighbor appellant even admitted that he used to be a customer in the benedictos sarisari store where he would buy cooking needs familiarity with the physical features particularly those of the face is the best way to identify a person thus in the absence of an established ill motive on the part of anacita her identification of appellant as her husbands killer should be given full faith and credit her relationship with the victim notwithstanding relationship with the victim per se is not proof of prejudice anacitas failure to name the weapon used by appellant and to recall his position as he stabbed ambrocio cannot diminish her credibility her relative position to the two accounts for anacitas failure to see the details surrounding the incident witnesses are not expected to remember every single detail of an incident with perfect or total recall nevertheless anacitas onemeter distance from the two enabled her to observe the manner by which appellant stabbed ambrocio — he did so in a manner described in the dialect as ""pakadyot"" meaning the bladed instrument came from underneath appellants positive identification of appellant as the perpetrator of the crime was thus proven beyond reasonable doubt by the consistent and firm testimony of anacita benedicto consequently such positive identification effectively effaced appellants alibi that she was the only eyewitness to the killing presented by the prosecution did not in any way dilute the evidentiary value of her credible testimony it is entrenched in jurisprudence that the testimony of a single witness if found convincing and credible by the trial court is sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt however appellant is correct in arguing that treachery did not attend the commission of the crime its presence was not established beyond reasonable doubt as this court said in people v derilo it is an ancient but revered doctrine that qualifying and aggravating circumstance before being taken into consideration for the purpose of increasing the degree of the penalty to be imposed must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as that which establishes the commission of the act charged as a criminal offense it is not only the central fact of a killing that must be shown beyond reasonable doubt; every qualifying and aggravating circumstance alleged to have been present and to have attended such killing must similarly be shown by the same degree of proof in this case the prosecution failed to discharge its duty under the law as regards the qualifying circumstance of treachery there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons employing means methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party may make to constitute treachery these two conditions must be present (1) employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and (2) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted treachery may not be appreciated where as in this case the attack against the victim cannot be categorized as unexpected and unforeseen so as to deprive him the opportunity to defend himself by the facts of the case where the incident of the victim berating the accused for throwing stones at his residence preceded the fatal assault a possible retaliation by the accused was not remote as this court has repeatedly held there is no treachery when the victim is placed on guard as when a heated argument preceded the attack especially when the victim was standing face to face with his assailant in that instance the initial assault could not have been unforeseen moreover where treachery is alleged the manner of attack must be proven absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded treachery cannot be appreciated it cannot be presumed or concluded merely on the basis of the resulting crime in the case at bar the prosecution presented anacitas ambiguous testimony on how the attack began to support its claim that treachery attended the commission of the crime thus q — before the stabbing was there conversation between them a — my husband went outside our terrace q — then what happened a — then i saw him stabbed q — by whom a — by angel q — what weapon a — i did not see the weapon used court q — how many times a — only once q — what did you do a — i shouted q — how far were you from the stabbing a — more or less one (1) meter fiscal q — madam witness when your husband was stabbed by angel rios what was his position at that time a — my husband was standing at that time q — where was your husband hit by the stab of angel rios a — in his right stomach q — what is the position of the accused when he stabbed your husband a — i did not see q — you did not see who stabbed your husband what i mean to say is was the accused also fronting your husband a — what i only saw your honor was my husband was stabbed"" (emphasis supplied) on crossexamination anacita testified as follows q — madam witness i will be showing to you transcript of stenographic notes taken down on may 31 1996 court what is the defense atty tolentino he did not do it your honor q — by the question of the court ""what was the position of the accused when he stabbed your husband"" witness a — ""i did not see"" it was ""pakadyot"" maam q — you said that the accused stabbed your husband in the manner that you said ""pakadyot"" will you tell the court when your husband was stabbed by the accused how was he positioned in relation to your husband a — he was facing my husband court q — sitting down or standing up a — they were standing up q — what about you what was the position of the accused in relation to you when you said you saw the incident a — i cannot understand where i was q — what about your position in relation to your husband when the incident was happening a — i only saw it when i went out x x x x x x x x x q — will you tell the honorable court the position of your husband in relation to you was your husbands back towards you or was your husband facing you a — my husbands back was in front of me q — what about the accused how was he positioned in relation to you a — the accused was facing me frontally atty tolentino q — and you said you were just one meter away from them a — i cannot remember because i did not see how he was stabbed from this testimony it is indubitable that anacita saw the stabbing incident but she could not describe exactly how it was commenced notwithstanding what appears to be her conclusion that the stabbing was done in a ""pakadyot"" manner this may perhaps be blamed on the frailty of human memory but it does not obliterate the fact the she actually saw the stabbing incident the doubt as to its manner or mode of execution should therefore be resolved in favor of the appellant "
G.R. No. L-25174,Homicide,1,that on or about the 7th day of june 1964 in the municipality of talugtog province of nueva ecija republic of the philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused conspiring and confederating with one another with intent to kill and with evident premeditation and by means of treachery did then and there wilfully unlawfully criminally and feloniously strike and hit one lorenzo grospe on his head with a piece of hard wood for several times thereby causing the instantaneous death of said lorenzo grospe pedro moreno and herminio caspillo were acquitted by the court of first instance of nueva ecija presided by judge placido c ramos and dionisio sibayan whose appeal is the subject of this decision was adjudged guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the sum of p6000 to suffer the accessories provided by law and to pay the costs witnesses for the prosecution seven all told were chief of police fidel dumandan of talugtog carmen castillo (surviving spouse of the deceased lorenzo grospe) barrio captain marceliano caspillo of osme? district in talugtog alejandro soriano municipal judge alfredo leybag of talugtog patrolman benjamin de fiesta of the same municipality and dr artemio da jose rural health officer the integrated testimony of carmen castillo marceliano caspillo alejandro soriano and benjamin de fiesta points unerringly to the appellant dionisio sibayan as the slayer of the deceased the victim lorenzo grospe and dionisio sibayan were neighbors it was about nine oclock on the night of june 7 1964 when these two had an altercation immediately followed by sibayan attacking grospe with a piece of hard wood fracturing the latters skull and causing his death alejandro soriano and benjamin de fiesta identified sibayan as the assailant of the deceased soriano likewise declared that he saw sibayan standing over the dying victim; de fiesta further testified that he saw him run away from the scene of the crime de fiesta even gave chase but was unable to apprehend him supporting the declarations of these two witnesses was the admission to marceliano caspillo made by the appellants wife (clarita castillo) in the presence of de fiesta and soriano that her husband succeeded in killing grospe in spite of her attempt to stop him municipal judge leybag testified that he notarized exhibit a which in essence is a sworn confession accomplished by sibayan and which substantially recites that it was he who killed the deceased by hitting him on the head with a piece of wood judge leybag further declared that he inquired from the appellant whether the confession was voluntary and whether the statements contained therein were correct and true and that sibayan replied in the affirmative it is also undenied that in the morning of the next day sibayan and his wife disappeared from talugtog which fact left its indelible impression on the judge a quo prompting him to remark (in his decision) in connection therewith that not only did he run away from the scene of the incident but he disappeared entirely from talugtog that evening as well as in the following days what dionisio sibayan did was to fly away from the scene of the incident and from talugtog according to him he proceeded to manila to look for work it is strange however why even his wife had to leave early that very morning if the purpose only of sibayan in going to manila to look for work considering however that dionisio sibayan is related to the deceased lorenzo grospe and it is the custom in the rural communities for anyone to attend to the burial of his relatives the court cannot reconcile itself to the explanation of dionisio sibayan that instead of attending the burial of a relative he would leave so early in the morning for manila to look for work at least if this is so his wife should have remained but even his wife disappeared when dionisio sibayan left talugtog that evening and could not be seen anymore the only logical conclusion that could be established is that he really fled away from the scene of the crime this flight indicates the consciousness of guilt on the part of dionisio sibayan only the appellant testified for the defense after a perceptive and careful examination of his declarations it is sufficient for us to state in appraisal of his testimony that (1) his denial of the voluntariness of the execution of exhibit a cannot stand in the face of the positive testimony of judge leybag to the contrary and (2) that the material contradictions between the appellants testimony in court and the contents of exhibit a render doubtful — so the court noted and with which we agree — the veracity of his testimony in court 
G.R. No. L-28574,Murder,2,the accused reynaldo villase?r was in 1964 then a special agent of the provincial governor of marinduque and as such special agent was issued by pacifica monteagudo property clerk of the provincial treasurers office a 38 caliber pistol with serial number 307829 together with a magazine and holster but without ammunition (exh h4) the corresponding receipt therefor was duly signed by the accused (exhs h h1 to h4) the evidence of the prosecution shows that the police sergeant madla single was a graduate in criminology from the philippine college of criminology in manila a member of the police force of boac marinduque and was promoted to police sergeant sometime in february 1964 on april 26 1964 he was detailed as field sergeant of a twentyfourhour duty which detail was recorded in the police blotter (exhs b and b1) as such field sergeant his area of assignment was the entire municipality of boac at about eight oclock in the evening of april 26 1964 sergeant madla together with patrolmen serafin sebua and lope jimena was patrolling the market place of boac they were seated in a row with their backs to and near the wall of the salvo drugstore about one and onehalf meters from the police outpost at the street intersection (exhs g and g1)t????hqw?? sergeant madla was seated on an empty wooden box with patrolman sebua to his left and his right was patrolman jimena who was then on a batibot chair sergeant madla was then in civilian clothing consisting of a dark pants and a striped polo shirt tucked in waist (see pictures exhs e1 to e16) his gun was buttoned up inside the leather holster hanging from his belt by his right waist beside the outpost is an electric post from which hanged a 50watt bulb which was then lighted about four meters above the ground the said police outpost and the salvo drugstore are the corner of isok street and another street facing the market place while the three were conversing between 800 and 830 that evening the accussed suddenly appeared about three feet in front of them with a drawn gun asked sergeant madla whether he was still mad at him and lately fired four shots at madla before the latter could reply and before anyone of them could do anything fearing that they might be hit policemen jimena and sebua ran away with patrolman sebua seeking cover in a refreshment parlor across the street about twentyfive meters away as he sprinted towards the other side of the street patrolman sebua heard three more shots thereafter he saw the accused fleeing towards the direction of the municipality of mogpog after the accused had gone patrolman sebua and jimena returned to the place of the incident and sergeant madla lying on his back drenched in his own blood with his gun still button up inside its holster hanging by his right waist and touching the ground (exhs e3 and e11) police sebua sent somebody to call photographer and instruct the people gathered around to keep away from the scene of the incident which he guarded until mayor jose madrigal chief of police jose reyes and pc major nacino arrived followed by pc sergeant andres jinang who was summoned by major nacino sgt jinang conduct an investigation on the spot as well as inspected the place of the incident where he found seven empty shells and four slugs all coming from a 38 caliber pistol (exhs i i1 to i12)t????hqw?? another slug was found embedded in the asphalt under the corpse of the victim said fifth slug was turned over to pc sgt jinang the following morning as directed by sgt jinang commercial photographer sergio montemar took eleven shots of the victim and scene of the crime that same night before the cadaver was brought to the hospital that same night (exhs e e1 to e10) which pictures he turned over to the provincial fiscal state witness serafin sebua clearly and positively identified the accused appellant reynaldo villase?r as the assailant he could not have failed to identify the appellant because the appellant was only about three feet away from him and beneath a lighted 50watt bulb about four meters above them atop a post about two yards away even if his eyes get watery since the japanese occupation for he was not then wearing the dark glasses he had on while testifying and he could then as now see clearly about 20 meters away he categorically stated that he was sure that it was the appellant who shot the victim the record does not disclose any ulterior motive on his part to perjure himself against appellant the appellant was the only person directly in front of them confronting the deceased with a drawn gun this positive identification of appellant as the murderer renders unnecessary any proof of motive on his partappellants belief that policeman lope jimena who was with the victim and sebua at the time of the assault would have been a better witness as to identity of the assailant is pure speculation the fact that he might have been a better witness does not necessarily negate sebuas ability to the face and heard the voice of the accused moments before he fired the first four shots at the victim the candor of sebua in admitting that his affidavit does not contain the number of shot fired by the accused and instead states that the accused shot the deceased without asking any question accentuates his truthfulness he explained that he did not notice the discrepancy when he signed it that the prosecution did not present patrolman jimena as a witness to be considered a reversible error; because aside from the fact that jimena was merely a corroborative witness and therefore not necessary for the prosecution to establish its case he was equally available to the defense if the defense was minded to do so the record shows that the prosecution reserved patrolman jimena for rebuttal but which reservation became useless because the accused submitted the case for decision and expressly waived his right to present evidence in his defense however as correctly mandated by the defense and the solicitor general the crime of direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority has not been established by evidence beyond reasonable doubt the record is bereft of any proof even remotely suggesting that the accused herein knew that the victim was then performing his official functions as police sergeant the victim was not in uniform at the time as shown by pictures (exhs e e1 e2 e7 and e11) the deceased was then wearing dark pants and a polo shirt tucked inside his waistline while the deceased then had his service firearm buttoned inside its holster hanging by his right waist and was then with two of his policemen these facts alone do not indicate that he was then in the performance of his police duties and there is no showing that the accused appellant personally knew of the entry in the police blotter that deceased was then on twentyfourhour duty as field sergeant (exhs d d1 and d2 p 62 of exh d) much less is there proof that the assault on the victim was provoked or by reason of an act performed by the victim in his official capacity likewise there is no evidence of the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation the time interval between the act if any on the part of the deceased that might have provoked the accused appellant or the time when the deceased might have intimated his anger at appellant and that actual killing is not shown consequently we cannot determine whether the accused appellant had sufficient time within which to reflect on the evil character of the crime before he committed the same but the qualifying circumstance of treachery had been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt while mere suddenness of a frontal attack may not necessarily be indicative of treachery; the circumstances surrounding the frontal attack made by the appellant on his victim indubitably demonstrate treachery on his part despite the fact that both the victim and patrolman lope jimena were armed policeman sebua was with them and the scene was welllighted by a 50watt bulb just about four meters above them (1) the appearance of the accused before the three was so sudden that the three did not even notice the direction from where he came and patrolman sebua was so surprised that he just gaped at the accused gripped by the fear that he might be hit after the accused fired his already drawn gun at the victim (2) the accused appeared with a drawn gun pointed directly at the deceased ready to fire at will the moment anyone of the three more particularly the victim would make any move (3) the accused fired four successive shots at the victim at a distance of about three feet soon after he asked the victim whether be was still angry with him before the victim could retort and before anyone of the three could stir in their seats (4) to further insure that the victim could not possibly adopt any measure of selfdefense the accused appellant pumped four successive shots into the cardiac and pleural cavities of the victim followed by three more shots as policeman sebua and jimena scampered for their own safety the victim was not even able to reach for his gun much less unbutton the flap which secured it inside its holster that seven shots were fired by the accused at the victim as evidenced by the seven empty shells and five slugs of a 38 caliber firearm found near the body of the victim shows that one bullet was already inside the chamber of the gun while six bullets were in its magazine one of the five slugs was found embedded in the asphalt beneath the cadaver of the victim

from the lighted watt bulb after emptying his firearm into the victims body thus eluding apprehension even as the chief of police and a companion pursued him towards the neighboring town of mogpog 
G.R. No. L-26867,Murder,2,"that on or about the 29th day of june 1963 in the evening in the home economics building within the school premises at bo enriqueta lavezares samar philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused armed with deadly weapons conspiring confederating together and mutually helping one another with intent to kill evident premeditation and treachery and taking advantage of their superiority in strength and number and without any justifiable cause did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and stab one felipe avendano with said weapons which the herein accused had provided themselves for the purpose thereby inflicting upon said felipe avendano two mortal stab wounds one at the back of the head and the other at the back on the left scapula which mortal wounds caused the instantaneous death of the latter the version of the prosecution was unfolded by prosecution witnesses carlos avendano lydia avendano antonio martires and dr arturo dubongco carlos avenda? son of the deceased testified that in the evening of june 29 1963 he was at a window of the home economics building located in barrio enriqueta lavezares samar watching a benefit dance going on inside the said building his sister lydia avendano was also outside near another window felipe avendano their father after dancing for sometime went near a window located close to the door of the building and fanned himself about a fathom away to the rear of his father and two arms length away from carlos were three persons standing at a japanese bamboo grove namely manuel guinto pedro alcantara and enrique cagsawa all of a sudden his father was attacked from behind by these men manuel guinto first slashed his father at the back of the head with a bolo locally known as ""kinogon"" almost simultaneously his father was stabbed in the back by alcantara with a bolo known locally as ""menasbad"" carlos knows alcantara well because the latter was a resident of barrio enriqueta lavezares samar enrique cagsawa was posed to strike his father but lydia avendano shouted ""enough!"" and the three (alcantara guinto and cagsawa) fled then carlos rushed to his father who forthwith told him that he was slashed by pedro alcantara and manuel guinto and bade him fetch his mother when later he and his mother arrived they found the victim already dead lydia avenda?s testimony corroborated that of her brother antonio martires sanitary inspector of lavezares samar testified that on june 30 1963 while he was in the poblacion of lavezares samar he was summoned to examine the wounds sustained by felipe avendano he certified to the following injuries a stab wound at the back of the head at least 5?inches in length b stab wound at the back on the left scapula at least 3 inches in length dr arturo dubongco resident physician of the northern samar general hospital testified that the first wound made by a bladed instrument caused death by reason of hemorrhage but that the second wound not cause death unless complications set in the version of the defense was adduced through the declarations of pedro alcantara ignacio gabion dr leovigildo mijares jr and primo cupido testifying in his own behalf alcantara declared that on june 26 and 27 1963 he was at sitio bayang barrio enriqueta samar gathering coconuts he and a companion ignacio gabion were then making copra he climbed 20 coconuts on the first day and 30 coconuts on the second at around 300 pm of the second day he fell face downward from a coconut tree because he slipped from a notch around four meters high he was able to reach his house only with the help of ignacio gabion who carried him up to his house located in sitio baysay barrio enriqueta lavezares samar the next day june 28 he was loaded by his elder sister bonifacia alcantara in a bus belonging to vicente balasolla and taken to catarman samar where he stayed in the house of another sister lucila who told him to return while she called for dr leovigildo mijares to treat him they left sitio baysay at around 800 am and reached catarman at about 1100 am at around 600 pm of june 28 dr leovigildo mijares jr arrived and examined his body and thereafter gave him three tablets to be taken in the morning noon and evening dr mijares returned to his sisters house in the evening (about 600) of the next day june 29 and inquired about the pains in his chest and in his right and left hips informed that the pains were still bothering him dr mijares again gave him three tablets and told him that if the pains would not subside he (the doctor) would bring him to the hospital the doctor did not tarry long in his sisters house alcantara was in the house of his sister lucila during the whole day of june 29 on june 30 he was brought by his sister to the hospital where he stayed for four days after which he returned to his sisters house after three more days in catarman he went home to lavezares where upon arrival he was arrested by a policeman and brought to the chief of police of lavezares for investigation regarding the death of felipe avendano he disclaimed any knowledge of the killing and expressed surprise why he was accused thereof he knows the other accused manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa and also lydia and carlos avendano the children of the deceased but he does not know why the latter two implicated him before the death of felipe avendano there had arisen no trouble nor did any illfeeling exist between him and the former ignacio gabions testimony corroborated that of alcantara with respect to their making of copra and his fall from a coconut tree dr leovigildo mijares jr testified on the medical treatment of the accused and the latters confinement at the northern samar general hospital in connection with which he issued medical certificates exhibits 2 and 3 primo cupido stated that in the evening of june 29 he was in barrio enriqueta lavezares samar watching the benefit dance at the home economics building at that time he was the barrio lieutenant sometime during the dance because people suddenly scampered away from the place he looked around and found felipe avendano wounded and lying face down by the door of the schoolhouse when he asked avendano what happened to him the latter could not make reply then as cupido withdraw to the center of the hall felipe avendano stood up to lean on the wall of the schoolhouse but fell down after 2 or 3 seconds he tried to question the deceased once more but when the latter failed to answer he informed the relatives about the incident when he first saw the fallen felipe avenda? he did not see carlos or lydia avenda? beside the deceased he saw them beside their father only when he was already dead the people around denied any knowledge of the incident when he asked lydia if she saw who attacked her father the latter said she was not sure he was unable to investigate carlos avendano because he was continuously crying at the side of his father he notified the chief of police of lavezares samar about the incident on crossexamination he declared that felipe avenda? was once accused of killing one donato ligua a cousin of the witness but that the deceased escape prosecution because the case was amicably settled 1 the appellant puts squarely in issue the credibility of carlos avenda? and lydia avenda? the two eyewitnesses for the prosecution averring that their declarations aside from being biased because they are children of the deceased are not entitled to credit by reason of material inconsistencies his controversion of carlos avenda?s testimony that his father the deceased told him that he was slashed by manuel guinto and pedro alcantara and bade him fetch his mother is based on the testimony of dr dubongco that because of the nature of the wound sustained by the deceased at the back of his head which is 5?inches long it is possible that the speech center of the brain was impaired causing the deceased to lose his power of speech significantly although dubongco testified on the length of the wound he was silent on the matter of the depth thereof he based his theory of the possibility of brain injury only on the length of the wound it is however entirely probable that even if the wound was 5?inches long it was not deep enough to crack the skull and cause brain injury or if there was such injury it was not so severe as immediately to deprive the deceased of the power of speech in fact primo cupido himself a witness for the defense testified that felipe avendano after he had fallen to the ground yet succeeded in standing up and leaning on the wall of the schoolhouse for about 2 or 3 seconds it is not matter of conjecture that it takes a great deal more of effort to rise from a prone position than to speak at any rate this testimony of carlos avendano that when he rushed to his fathers side after the latter collapsed the latter identified his assailants to him and bade him fetch his mother carlos and lydia avenda? who at the trial were 13 and 18 years of age respectively had no reason to perjure themselves no motive has been shown for them to testify falsely against the appellant; in fact the latter admitted that he does not know of any reason why they should accuse him of such a grievous crime moreover the presence of these two witnesses at the time and in the general vicinity of the incident has not been impugned and in fact was even corroborated by the defense witness primo cupido to be sure cupido testified that when he arrived at the spot where felipe avendano fell carlos was not yet there; that when he interrogated the deceased he was already speechless; and that when he asked lydia avendano who attacked her father she allegedly answered that she was not sure in short the defense presented cupido to cast serious doubt on the identification made of the assailants but assuming his declarations to be essentially true still his testimony is not only reconcilable with that of the prosecution witnesses; it is in fact corroborative thereof it will be remembered that carlos at the time of the assault was nearer to his father than cupido thus when carlos went to the side of his father cupido was yet at the dance hall when cupido arrived therefore carlos had already left to fetch his mother at his fathers behest after a short while carlos avendano arrived with his mother verily carlos avenda?s mother who was admittedly not present at the dance would not have repaired without delay to the scene of the killing had carlos not seen what had earlier happened and had been ordered by his father to fetch his mother the appellant points to allegedly ""significant"" inconsistencies in lydias testimony to wit (1) whereas in her affidavit executed before the chief of police of lavezares samar she stated that she saw her father hacked twice by pedro alcantara in her direct testimony in open court she stated that her father was slashed first by manuel guinto at the back of the head and then by pedro alcantara; and (2) whereas in the same affidavit she mentioned that while she was crying after her father fell to the floor her brother carlos arrived and also cried on crossexamination she declared that carlos reached their fathers side ahead of her however these inconsistencies or discrepancies are evidently trivial and ""may justifiably be overlooked because it is not infrequent that a witness may without design inaccurately narrate certain facts arising from extraordinary occurrences as moore on facts 1098 has said an affidavit being taken ex parte is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate sometimes from partial suggestion and sometimes from want of suggestion and inquiries without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs to the subject""we must consider too the psychological stress which burdened lydia avendano when she appeared and executed the affidavit before the chief of police of lavezares samar only three days after she witnessed the slaying of her father this was a deeply traumatic experience which necessarily affected her equanimity with respect to cupidos averment that when he asked lydia avendano who killed her father she answered that she was not sure the reticence of lydia can be explained by the fact that cupidos cousin donato ligua was a slay victim at the hands of her father for this crime the deceased avendano was not convicted because the case was amicably settled it was reasonable for lydia to have assumed that cupido entertained a grudge against the deceased and his children because of this incident at all events we are convinced after a searching analysis and scrutiny of the testimony of lydia avendano visavis her affidavit that the contradictions in her declarations are trivial which cannot be ascribed to an insidious attempt to distort the truth it is a truism that the most candid witness oftentimes commits mistakes and incurs in inconsistencies in his declarations but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic credibility far from being evidence of falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith and in this case before us a confirmation of the fact that lydia avendano was not a rehearsed witnessthat carlos and lydia avendano were son and daughter respectively of the deceased does not suffice to discredit them on the contrary ""their natural interest in securing the conviction of his killers would deter them from implicating persons other than the culprits for otherwise the latter would thereby gain immunity""indeed we note that carlos and lydia appear to be persons who bore absolutely no illfeeling toward the accused; the record does not disclose any untoward motive which could have induced them to perjure themselves in a prosecution for a heinous crime the accused himself admits this absence of motive on the part of the witnesses it has been correctly held that when there is no showing of improper motive on the part of witnesses for testifying against the accused the fact that they are related to the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of full faith and credit2 further the appellant argues that since the evidence shows that the wound allegedly inflicted by him was merely superficial and would ordinarily have healed in seven days and that the prosecution presented nothing to prove the existence of conspiracy among pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa the liability of each of the accused is therefore merely individual and thus he should be convicted only of slight physical injuries it must be stated that the information charged pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa with ""conspiring confederating together and mutually helping one another"" in assaulting and stabbing to death felipe avendano article 8 of the revised penal code provides that conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it the agreement of which the law speaks is not limited to one which is written or otherwise expressly or directly made prior to the commission of the crimeit is not necessary that the malefactors for an appreciable time prior to the commission of the crime had actually come together and agreed in express terms to pursue a common designfor conspiracy to exist it is enough that at the time the offense was committed the participants had the same purpose and were united in its execution as may be inferred from the attendant circumstances to establish conspiracy it is not necessary to prove previous agreement to commit a crime if there be proof that the malefactors have acted in concert and in pursuance of the objective this court has repeatedly ruled that conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such point to a joint purpose and design their actions must be judged not by what they say for what men do is the best index of their intention thus this court has ruled in a similar milieu although there is no direct proof of conspiracy between the appellants the simultaneous presence of both at the scene of the crime the shot fired by appellant timoteo cruz immediately after valencia had been shot by felipe de la cruz and the circumstance that forthwith thereafter the latter boarded the formers car which was there ready for the getaway leave no room for doubt as to the existence of unity of action and purpose between them (people v cruz et al l15369 april 26 1962) while conspiracy to commit a crime must be established by positive evidence direct proof is not essential since by its nature it is planned in utmost secrecy consequently competent and convincing circumstantial evidence will suffice to establish it in this case before us although there is no direct evidence on the existence of conspiracy among pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa still the evidence unmistakably points to the fact that the three were at the japanese bamboo grove; that they stabbed the deceased in rapid succession cagsawa being unable to deliver his intended blow only because lydia the daughter of the deceased shouted ""enough!""; and that when lydia thus shouted they all fled together the foregoing convincingly demonstrates that the three accused acted in concert and in pursuance of the same objective joint purpose and design that is to kill the deceased and since in a conspiracy the act of the conspirators becomes the act of all responsibility for the act will be borne equally by all regardless of the degree of their respective participation in the execution of the act once an express or implied conspiracy is proved all of the conspirators are liable as coprincipals regardless of the extent and character of their respective active participation in the commission of the crime or crimes perpetrated in furtherance of the conspiracy because in contemplation of law the act of one is the act of all the foregoing rule is anchored on the sound principle that ""when two or more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object whether through the physical volition of one or all proceeding severally or collectively each individual whose evil will actively contributes to the wrongdoing is in law responsible for the whole the same as though performed by himself alone"" thus although it is axiomatic that no one is liable for acts other than his own ""when two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime each is responsible for all the acts of the others done in furtherance of the agreement or conspiracy"" 3 the appellants main defense in exculpation is alibi it must be stressed at the outset that alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by an accused especially if there is direct testimony of an eyewitness duly corroborated by that of another not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because of the ease of fabricating evidence of alibi and the difficulty of checking or rebutting it thus we held in people v estrada that — ""no jurisprudence in criminal cases is more settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and that the same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime such should be the rule for as a defense alibi is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove and for alibi to prosper it is not enough to prove that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed but he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time"" and in cases of positive identification of the culprit by reliable witnesses the defense of alibi must be established by ""full clear and satisfactory evidence"" or by evidence which reasonably satisfies the court of the truth of such defense we address ourselves therefore to the question of whether alcantara has established his defense of alibi by ""full clear and satisfactory evidence"" the defense of alibi is basically an attempt to show that the defendant was at some other place when the crime was committed for such length of time that it was impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed either before or after the time he was at such other place; or that the distance is such as to preclude the possibility and probability for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed; or that it would have been physically impossible for the accused by reason of illness or impaired physical condition to be at the place where the crime was committed thus the following major factors are to be considered in weighing the merits and demerits of an alibi distance the time and available means of travel the physical fitness of the accused for travel and the ability of the accused to finance a trip to the scene of the crime according to the appellant on june 26 and 27 1963 he was in sitio payang barrio enriqueta lavezares gathering coconuts as he and a companion ignacio gabion were then making copra he climbed 20 coconut trees on the first day and 30 coconut trees on the next before he fell from a height of about four meters he averred that he had been suffering from lumbar rheumatism for a considerable time and that dr leovigildo mijares had been treating him although he hastened to add that he had become well one year prior to june 1963 it is doubtful that one who has been suffering from this ailment for an appreciable period of time can climb 20 coconut trees on one day and then climb another 30 coconut trees on the next especially in the face of the categorical assertion of dr mijares that lumbar rheumatism recurs and cannot be completely cured thus that he did actually climb 50 coconut trees in two days as he claimed is placed in serious doubt more than this it is quite strange that although he stated that after he fell face down from the coconut tree he had to be carried up to his house by ignacio gabion because he could not walk and had to be loaded in a bus bound for catarman by his sister bonifacia alcantara — apparently in an attempt to show that he was in great pain — he did not seek immediate admission to the hospital he entered the hospital only on the third day after he arrived in catarman that is on june 30 the day after the deceased was killed moreover his testimony that he fell from a coconut tree loses its credibility in the face of the contradicting testimony of his own witness dr mijares to the effect that it was only when he entered the hospital on june 30 that he revealed his having fallen from a coconut tree is it not strange if it was really true that he fell from a coconut tree that he should fail to inform his doctor thereof on the very first day that the latter visited and treated him then again he testified that on june 28 he was treated for pains in the chest and in the right and left hips and that when he was asked on june 29 by dr mijares about the said pains he answered that his chest and hips were still painful dr mijares however testified that on those days he merely complained of severe lumbar pains — not chest pains or pains in the right and left hips — and informed the former that he could not walk in fact the medical certificate (exh 2) issued by dr mijares merely certifies to his being "" examined for lumbar rheumatism last june 28 and june 29/63"" it was only when he was already in the hospital that he complained to dr mijares about chest pains although significantly fluoroscopy did not reveal any fracture thus the medical certificate (exh 3) states that he was confined at the northern samar general hospital ""from june 30 to july 3 1963 for sprain chest"" moreover whether he was in such a serious condition that he could not walk is disputable because dr mijares testified that the appellants complaints were subjective symptoms that he (the doctor) could not really be sure that the appellant was in a serious condition but was merely informed by the latter that he could not walk in mijares own words as to his complaint that he was having lumbar pains the appellant ""could still move and walk around"" but mijares merely advised him to have complete rest in short the doctor without further bother took the appellants word at its face value that he was suffering from lumbar rheumatism was in serious condition and could not walk the integrated testimony of dr mijares should be accorded full credit not because it incidentally served to point up the essential falsity of the testimony of the appellant but principally because although he was the appellants own witness he turned out to be impartial intent solely as we see it on correctly apprising the trial court of the true occurrences and events in which he became directly involved against the backdrop of the foregoing inconsistencies in the testimony of the appellant and his witnesses it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the appellant went through all the trouble of going to catarman and being treated for alleged lumbar rheumatism on june 28 and 29 at the house of his sister by dr mijares and of being hospitalized for alleged chest sprain from june 30 to july 3 at the northern samar general hospital to conceal his participation in the slaying of felipe avendano in fine he was laying down the groundwork of his defense of alibi finally his defense of alibi must be rejected because of the possibility of easy access from catarman to lavezares although the evidence shows that the first trip by bus from catarman to allen which passes barrio enriqueta leaves catarman at 400 am the next at about 800 am and the last between 100 and 200 pm and that the distance between catarman and barrio enriqueta is about 32 kilometers negotiable in 3 to 4 hours still this does not discount the possibility that the accused could have rented a motor vehicle and left for barrio enriqueta after 800 pm on june 29 1963 after dr mijares had paid him a visit and given him tablets to take (he admits that dr mijares visited him at around 600 pm on june 29 and stayed for only a short time) arrived in barrio enriqueta a little past 1000 pm committed the crime charged and returned to catarman all told the evidence is not full not clear and not satisfactory that he was physically unfit for travel and that he could not afford to finance a trip to the scene of the crime being the owner of a coconut plantation thus contrary to the appellants allegations it was not physically impossible for him to have participated in the commission of the offense charged as to the possible motive of the appellant in killing the deceased or in participating therein the evidence reveals that two days before the killing the deceased came upon cagsawa gathering coconuts from his (the deceaseds) plantation and effectively prevented him from doing so this prompted cagsawa to challenge the deceased to a fight but the latter ran away the appellant is the first cousin of his coaccused enrique cagsawa the latters father and the appellants mother being brother and sister it is not therefore farfetched that the appellants involvement in the killing on the night of june 29 was in all likelihood an aftermath of the heated incident that transpired two days before at all events ""the defense of alibi is an issue of fact that hinges on credibility; the credibility of an alibi depends so much on the credibility of the witnesses who seek to establish it; and in this respect the relative weight which the trial judge assigns to the testimony of said witnesses must unless patently and clearly inconsistent with the evidence on record be accepted for as is well recognized his proximate contact with those who take the witness chair places him compared to appellate justices in the more competent position to discriminate between the true and the false""(people v estrada l26103 jan 17 1968 22 scra 111 citing people v constante l14639 dec 28 1964; and people v berdida et al l20183 june 30 1966) the conclusions of fact reached by a trial judge should be accorded great weight because he is in a better position than the appellate court to observe the behavior of the witnesses and evaluate their credibility "
G.R. Nos. 114263-64,Homicide,1,"hereunder is the recital of facts of the case as summarized by the trial court and duly substantiated by the evidence on record piecing together the testimonial and material evidence submitted in these cases the court cannot but conceive the following resume that on the night of june 20 1990 (sic) accused john jenn porras and sergio emelo went to the police station looking for pfc roldan emelo of the cavite city pnp a cousin of the latter and was directed by sgt pilapil to where he was; that they had some food and drinks at the banaue restaurant and emelo asked for his black ammo pouch and some 38 caliber ammunition; that thereafter perhaps in connivance with marcelo real of the philippine coast guard who was then moonlighting in his tricycle flagged him down along m gregorio st and in which marcos luciano was a passenger at the time and was told to alight as they were already overloaded and whereat luciano identified john jenn porras who was then wearing a maong jacket and maong pants when he was focused by the headlights of the incoming vehicle; that they proceeded to the aroma beer house where the victim rosendo mortel was tabled (sic) and wherein some misunderstanding happened and ronnie mortel went out and was shot at close range by either porras or emelo as seen by a waitress maribel herman who pointed to porras as the assailant and who after seeing rosendo mortel sprawled on the ground and bloodied fled into an alley and thereafter returned and shot the prostrate victim twice and sped away and who hailed sgt catalino bermas (sic) was then monitoring the situation as an intelligence operative on his motorcycle to give chase; that during the shooting jose malumay who was on a bicycle on his way home after going to a house near sangley point also heard a gun shot which he mistook for a blowout and when he offered to assist he saw two men one in dark attire and the other in white tshirt who from the information of the witnesses fixed their identities as the two accused john jenn porras and sergio emelo who fired the initial shot and ran away and later on returned to finish the job with porras allegedly having fired the last two shots killing the victim instantaneously as he was brought to the hospital dead on arrival during the chase given by catalino bermas he was shot by emelo along the way after having told them (emelo and real) to go to the police station and bermas feeling the effects of his wounds chanced upon cpl dela cruz in front of the 501 beer house and asked for his assistance and they rode in tandem and pursued the tricycle at the saulog terminal compound where only the tricycle was left together with the driver marcelo real who pointed to the two accused as the assailants sgt amorico alvarez who was then following up unsolved cases in the station was apprised of the shooting and went to the place and was informed about the identity (sic) of the tricycle which they traced to the house of real whereat they found the black ammo pouch and the camouflage holster with the name of emelo inscribed and with live and spent bullets on the back seat and putting together the evidence thus far gathered he was able to apprehend the three namely porras emelo and real now to dispose of the issues raised appellants claim that some of the trial courts factual findingsare product of imagination and gross misrepresentation allegedly due to lack of evidentiary support while our examination of the record shows that the assailed factual findings are in some respects inaccurate they however did not debilitate the prosecutions case and neither did they affect the appellants finding of guilt spo3 rolando villegas one of the prosecutions witnesses indeed positively identified the appellants as the persons who showed up at the cavite city police station at around 900 oclock in the evening of june 19 1990 looking for pfc roldan emelo — persons who the record reveals were responsible for the dastardly crimes thus x x x x x x x x x q while doing it mr witness while waiting for this report you have just mentioned can you tell the court if there was an incident which

a yes maam q when the two men got your answer what did they do a they proceeded to the traffic division and a few moments later they went out(emphasis supplied) next appellants impugn the credibility of the prosecution witnesses by citing the seeming inconsistency between the testimonies of maribel german who apparently saw one assailant and jose malumay who on the other hand claimed to have seen two assailants the following are excerpts of the questioned testimonies jose malumay x x x x x x x x x q what was this incident kindly relate to the honorable court a on that night from sangley going

wearing a tshirt and maong pants and rubber shoesa closer scrutiny of maribel germans testimony reveals that she merely saw an assailant shoot the victim (mortel) while sprawled on the ground but nowhere in her testimony did she state that there is only one assailant in fact maribel german never testified witnessing the crime from its inception which jose malumay witnessed to have been authored by two assailants this explains the apparent inconsistency between the witnesses testimonies at any rate the alleged inconsistency just discussed which was shown to be otherwise is neither substantial nor of such nature to cast a serious doubt on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses the established rule of evidence is that inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect either the substance of their declaration their veracity or the weight of their testimonyinconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses if only in minor details reinforce rather than weaken their credibility for it is usual that witnesses to a stirring event should see differently some details of a startling occurrence"" discrepancies on minor details which do not destroy the substance of the witness testimony show that the witness was not rehearsedappellants defense of alibi must likewise fail against their positive identification alibi cannot prevail prosecution witness marcos luciano positively identified appellant john jenn porras as one of the persons who were on board the tricycle which was used as get away vehicle by mortels assailants just before midnight on june 19 1990;spo3 rolando villegas identified sergio emelo and john jenn porras as the persons who arrived at the pnp station looking for pfc roldan emelo at around 900 oclock on that evening of june 19 1990;maribel german described one of the assailants as wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes and was riding in a tricycle;and sgt catalino bermas confirmed the person described by maribel german to be sergio emelothe same person he identified as his assailant on that same nightfurthermore proof that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed is not enough appellants must likewise demonstrate that they could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or in its vicinity at the time of its commissionin this connection we quote with approval the trial courts observation the alibi set up by the two accused that they were in their barracks sleeping all the time up to early morning is of no moment as alibi is the weakest of all defenses specially (sic) so when the place where they alleged to have been at the time of the commission of the offense and the situs where the incident happened is (sic) not so far (sic) distant from each other and maybe (sic) reached within a reasonable time which in the instant cases are no more than 100 or 200 meters apartappellants also contend that the nonpresentation of cpl crisanto de la cruz one of the police officers who first investigated the crime and pfc roldan emelo the police officer who gave appellant sergio emelo the black ammo pouch bag and 38 caliber bullets is fatal to the prosecutions case we find this contention devoid of merit the matter of deciding whom to present as witness for the prosecution is not for the accused or for the trial court to decide as it is the prerogative of the prosecutor"" moreover if the appellants believed that the testimony of the said police officers would bolster their theory then they could have availed of the compulsory process to have the latter produced as their witnesseswhich they failed to do so appellants likewise characterize as hearsay the testimony of sgt amorico alvarez on pfc roldan emelos statements to the police investigator implicating them to the crime this contention is bereft of legal basis for it is a settled rule that when a testimony is presented to establish not the truth but the tenor of a statement or the fact that such statement was made as in this case the same is not hearsay furthermore appellants conviction did not hinge solely on the assailed testimony as there were other evidence extant in the records establishing their guilt beyond reasonable doubt finally appellants argue that they were not positively identified in open court by the two prosecutions witnesses (german and malumay) to be the culprits hence they may not be convicted of the crime charged the argument is specious and erroneously assumes that there was no identification made while witnesses german and malumay did not point out the appellants in open court they nonetheless described the perpetrators attire at the time of the commission of the crime with one assailant wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes and the other assailant wearing a dark attire these descriptions conform with the other witnesses testimony identifying the appellants to be wearing the same attire during the commission of the crimes in any event it is a settled rule that there can be a conviction based on circumstantial evidence when the circumstances proved form an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion pinpointing the accused to the exclusion of all others as the perpetrator of the crimeas in this case in order that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to convict the same must comply with these essential requisites viz (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubtthe record reveals that there were at least eleven circumstances correctly considered by the trial court in arriving at its judgment of conviction viz moments before the incident of june 20 1990 appellants were seen inside the cavite city pnp station looking for pfc roldan emelo; (2) appellant sergio emelo was then wearing a white tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes while appellant john jenn porras was wearing a sleeveless cream tshirt maong pants and was carrying a maong jacket(3) on the same evening just before the incident appellant john jenn porras then wearing a maong jacket was seen on board the tricycle of marcelo real together with a man wearing a white tshirt;(4) the two assailants were described by jose malumay as respectively wearing a dark attire and white tshirt(5) one of the persons who shot rosendo mortel was described by maribel german as wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes;(6) the assailants of rosendo mortel bearded a tricycle to flee from the scene of the crime(7) sergio emelo was identified by sgt catalino bermas as the person on board the tricycle that fled from the scene of the crime; (8) sergio emelo was identified by sgt catalino bermas as the person who shot him during the chase;(9) a magazine pouch camouflaged holster with the name emelo 38 caliber empty shells and live bullets were found immediately after the shooting on the floor of the tricycle used by the appellants; (10) rosendo mortel and sgt catalino bermas both sustained gunshot wounds from a 38 caliber handgun;and (11) the flight of the appellants which was not sufficiently explained there is no reason for us to disagree with the trial court on these matters these findings are fully supported by the evidence on record and constitute an unbroken chain of events which by their concordant combination and cumulative effect more than satisfy the requirements for the conviction of the appellantsthe trial court however erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery in criminal case no 24591 treachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itselfand to appreciate it two conditions must concur viz (a) the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate and (b) that said means of execution be deliberately and consciously adopted in this regard the prosecution failed to definitively establish the manner in which the initial assault against the deceased victim was committed to justify the appreciation of treachery this hiatus in the prosecutions evidence cannot be substituted by mere suppositions as what the trial court apparently did it is a well settled rule that in order to appreciate treachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression as in this case the same must be shown present at the inception of the attackabsent any showing therefor treachery as a qualifying circumstance may not be considered "
