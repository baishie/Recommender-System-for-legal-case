there according to prosecution witness biato mapon widowed soninlaw of sayawon the couple kept two  2  jars of money in coins amounting to p200000; biato had carried these jars himself when they transferred from the old house  tsn 13 june 1967 page 10  dana the wife of biato and amping a son of sayawon also lived in the same dwelling along a trail leading to sayawons house is the house of bastiana soling prosecution witness anselmo gumalay testified that he was there on 25 september 1965 at around 400 oclock in the afternoon  to judge from the position of the sun  and while grinding corn by the doorway he saw three  3  persons pass by; he recognized one of them to be the accused teofilo gande the witness did not recognize the other two because their hats were titled covering their eyes  tsn 13 june 1967 pages 1213  the principal witness of the prosecution teofilo sandalan who did not know his age was estimated to be 14 years old at the time he testified in 1967 this witness declared that he and his uncle sayawon lumigaw went to the   parian   on 25 september 1965; sayawon won a cock there and on their way home sayawon invited teofilo to drop by his house as he wanted to give him half of the cock they arrived at sayawons house at about 500 oclock in the afternoon reckoned by the position of the sun; they found three  3  men already in the house armed with long boloes sandalan recognized two of them as teofilo gande and victoriano gande because they were abaca strippers in the plantation of sayawon; he did not know the third man teofilo gande requested that he and his two companions be allowed to pass the night in the house as it was already getting dark after witness teofilo sandalan had received his share of the cock he left and proceeded home when he was some 70 to 80 meters away by a brook where he had defecated he heard a womans shout for help he returned to sayawons house; he did not go up but went underneath the house and through the splitbamboo flooring and by the dim light of a   gotapercha   lamp  it was already twilight  he saw the accused teofilo gande cutting the neck of sayawon who lay upon a mortar witness sandalan did not tarry but rushed home and told his parents what he saw; they did not believe him as he had been wont to lie to them but when they went to sayawons house the following morning to verify what their son had related they found the four  4  occupants of the house dead sayawons body was on top of a mortar his head almost severed at the neck; dagaw hacked at the back of the neck lay on the floor near the stove; amping lay face downward where he used to sleep hacked at the nape and on the arm; and dana was sprawled flat on her stomach at the attic injured at the epigastric region  tsn 23 february 1967 pages 3242; 24 february 1967 pages 2 8 and 27; 13 june 1967 page 6  pc sgt cleofe jonco testified that he had teofilo gande investigated on 9 october 1965; that he propounded the questions and gande supplied the answers which were reduced to writing  tsn 23 february 1967 pages 23 ; that thereafter on 11 october 1965 sgt alberto orquillas brought teofilo gande to the municipal judge to swear to the truth of his statements but according to orquillas after talking to a certain person gande refused to sign the statement for no reason at all  tsn 23 february 1967 page 8  the unsigned statement exhibit   a   purported to confess teofilo gandes participation in a conspiracy to rob the household of sayawon; his presence there during the killing of the four victims not by him but by his brother victoriano and one malcolm; and his confessing to the philippine constabulary officers because he was not given a share of the booty that malcolm had taken from a jar in the attic on the side of the defense accusedappellant teofilo gande testifying in his behalf claimed that during the whole day of 25 september 1965 he together with eight  8  other persons including his brother victoriano worked   bayanihan   style in the farm of rosario limbaring in barrio lalud until sundown; when they stopped working they took their   merienda   and then teofilo gande went home  tsn 12 july 1967 pages 3034  this alibi deserves no credit for the supporting witnesses abdul and sofronio lumbay were vague and uncertain in their statements the only circumstance of which they were positive was of gandes presence at the   songlo    cooperative work  on 25 june but could not supply details about the work on the other days of the week we conclude that no error was committed by the court in rejecting the alibi of appellant appellant testified that three  3  pc soldiers manhandled him one after the other to compel him to sign exhibit   a  ; that he was shown the said exhibit already prepared but did not see how it was prepared; that as a result of the maltreatment he suffered injuries which he had shown to the judge of tudela and to a friend abdul lumbay who visited him in jail; that he did not recognize his torturers because it was nighttime; and that he is illiterate and belongs to the subano tribe  tsn 12 july 1967 pages 24 10  the version of the appellant is supported by judge solidario agot of tudela who testified that exhibit   a   was presented to him but that the supposed affiant appellant teofilo gande   disagreed on all the statement of that affidavit   and   refused to sign because it was not voluntarily made by him  ; and that he saw a fresh contusion on the lower part of gandes right eye but the latter did not complain that he was maltreated by the pc  tsn 19 july 1967 pages 34 8  it is regrettable that the judge did not examine the rest of the body of appellant to ascertain whether he suffered other injuries however the circumstances sufficiently infirm the reliability of the purported confession particularly since there is no independent evidence of the alleged robbery; no proof exists on the record that the coins asserted by witness biato mapon to have been kept in two jars placed in the attic were still there when the crime was committed that the accused did not complain of torture to judge agot is not to be wondered at for being in the custody of his torturers he was reasonably apprehensive of further maltreatment if he complained in view of the circumstances of record the alleged statements of appellant are rejected as of no probative value with the alleged confession  exhibit   a    aside the evidence on the alleged conspiracy consists of the testimony of anselmo gumalay to the effect that he saw teofilo gande with two companions pass by the house of bastiana soling towards the house of sayawon lumigaw while said witness was grinding corn and the testimony of teofilo sandalan that he saw the gande brothers and a third man armed with long boloes when he and sayawon came from the   parian   and that he saw gande cutting the neck of sayawon sandalan had vacillated in his testimony or was unsure of what victorians gande and the third man did or were doing when gande was cutting sayawons neck and it was on account of this uncertainty that the lower court acquitted victoriano gande  the third man was not charged in the information  such action of the appellant and his brother and even of the nonaccused third man do not warrant a finding of the existence of a conspiracy just because they were seen together draws no inference of a common plan to commit a crime there is no convincing evidence that victorians and the third man committed any overt act or actively participated in concert with appellants act of killing sayawon or in connection with the death of the other victims as to deduce a unity of action and purpose among themselves  article 8 revised penal code; people vs asaad 55 phil 697; people vs wong l2213032 29 april 1968; people vs vicente l26241 21 may 1969  nor is there evidence that the money testified to by mapon as having been kept in the attic was still there or that it was taken away by the accused after the death of the four  4  victims none of the witnesses for the prosecution who went to the house after the commission of the crime testified as to the absence or loss of the money;

homicide,   that on or about the 14th day of march 1996 at or about 1045 in the evening in barangay san juan municipality of panaon province of misamis occidental philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused conspiring confederating and helping one another with intent to kill and armed with bladed weapons entered the residence of one gedie galindo and once inside taking advantage of nighttime and with treachery did then and there attack assault stab and wound said gedie galindo thereby inflicting upon him with  sic  fatal wounds on different parts of his body which caused the immediate death of said gedie galindo the facts as established during the trial are as follows on march 14 1996 at about 600 pm spouses gerundino galindo and edna ho galindo had finished supper like most residents of sitio conalum barangay san juan panaon misamis occidental they slept early they left two kerosenefueled   vigil   lamps burning in the kitchen and dining area at around 1045 pm edna was suddenly awakened by the loud cry for help from their eldest son gedie she woke her husband up gerundino rushed to the kitchen there gerundino saw a bloodied gedie grappling with vicente hilot the latter was holding a bloodstained hunting knife gerundino lost no time in rushing to aid his wounded son he grabbed a fistful of hilots hair disarmed and pinned him to the floor meanwhile gedie who was stabbed in the chest moved back to lean on the kitchen wall suddenly the kitchen door opened and gerundino saw appellant patrocinio bihag jr enter with a hunting knife before gerundino could react bihag stabbed gedie in the neck gerundino let go of hilot and went to assist his son the stab wound was fatal hilot and bihag immediately flededna had followed her husband to the kitchen and there witnessed the stabbing of her songerundinos sister and neighbor saturnina galindo also heard gedies shout for help she grabbed a flashlight and rushed to find out what was happening she saw bihag jump out of her brothers house holding a bloody knife followed by hilot she rushed to gerundinos house where she saw gedies parents carrying his limp body prosecution witness dr arden c mangubat municipal health officer of panaon misamis occidental conducted an autopsy that showed gedie had sustained two wounds one in the neck and another in the chest the wounds were of the same size and possibly caused by the same knifeaccording to dr mangubat the neck wound was most likely the fatal one since it penetrated the trachea the air passage to the lungsduring his trial appellant bihag put up the defense of alibi he said that on the night of the alleged murder he was at his residence in barangay talic oroquieta city with his common law wife melbahe was receiving  tallying bets in   masiao   a game of chance the following day they went to sinacaban misamis occidental where they operated another gambling game   hantak   he had been   hantak   operator for the past ten years on crossexamination appellant said that when he learned he was a suspect in the killing of gedie he went to see mayor francisco paylaga of panaon misamis occidental the mayor said not to worry about the caseas a result he did not bother to verify from the police why he was a suspect he did not secure affidavits from witnesses regarding his whereabouts at that time of the gedies death appellant insists that the only reason he was charged in this case for murder is his close relationship with coaccused hilot defense witness dioscoro tadocorroborated appellants alibi tado narrated that while appellants wife was busy attending to bettors and waiting for the tally sheets he and appellant had a drinking spree which lasted from 700 to 1030 pm he said appellant never left the building where they were staying in separate apartmentswitnesses josephine tado disocoros wife corroborated his story concerning appellants whereaboutsappellants spouse melba took the stand to confirm mrs tados storythe prosecution presented diosdado luminot as rebuttal witness he said he was on his way home that fateful evening at approximately midnight when he met appellant and hilot walking away from the gerundino house both were holding bloody knives he greeted them but got no response upon reaching gerundinos place he noticed several persons there he was told that there was a robbery in gerundinos housethe appeal boils down to the issue of the identification of the appellant patrocinio bihag jr as one of the assailants which in turn hinges on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses as well as the tenability of appellants alibi in convicting appellant the trial court relied upon the positive identification of appellant by the victims parents appellant claims that the witnesses were mistaken since the scene of the crime was allegedly unlit at the time of the incident for the state the office of the solicitor general in turn argues that appellants claim lacks merit to assail the positive identification made by the galindos solely because of poor lighting is unconvincing that two kerosene lamps lighted the scene of the crime sufficient for the witnesses to identify the malefactors was not rebutted successfully by the defense jurisprudence has held that the light cast by a petroleum lampis more than sufficient for categorical identification of a felon where two kerosene lamps furnished the illumination as in this case the positive identification of the culprit becomes even more difficult to impeachand thus should be accepted appellant however lays stress on the fact that when the police initially investigated the killing gerundino failed to name the killers of his son it was only on march 18 1996 or four days later that the parents implicated him he insists that this belated identification is highly suspect the solicitor general argues the galindos withholding of perpetrators names should not detract from their positive identification of appellant the galindos initially wanted to avenge their sons death motivating them to keep to themselves the assailants identities that the parents later changed their minds does not detract from their positive identification of appellant as one of the assailants delay of a witness in reporting the crime to police authorities when adequately explained does not impair the witness credibility nor render his testimony biased or destroy its probative valuefear of reprisaldeath threatsthe resulting mental shock or disturbance as a result of having experienced or witnessed a violent crimeand even a natural reluctance not to be involved in a criminal casehave been accepted as adequate explanations for the delay in reporting crimes moreover there is no rule that the suspect in a crime should be hurriedly named by a witnesspositive identification of a culprit is of great weight in determining whether an accused is guilty or notour review of the evidence shows that the galindos did not err in pointing to appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime he was well known in their place because he was a   hantak   operator the defense admitted appellant had long known gerundinothere was no bad blood between themand there was no reason for the galindos to falsely accuse appellant furthermore two other witnesses  luminot and saturnina   corroborated the testimony concerning appellants presence at the locus criminis appellant as well as his coaccused held a knife according to luminot no ill motive was attributed to these witnesses that could make them falsely testify against appellant thus we find no cogent reason to overturn the trial courts holding that appellant was positively and unequivocally identified as one of the victims assailants appellant next insists that the trial court erred in disregarding his alibi inasmuch as disinterested witnesses corroborated it in finding appellants alibi less than foolproof the trial court observed   it is of judicial knowledge that the asphalted road between oroquieta city and panaon misamis occidental has a distance of about 15 kilometers one traveling in a motor vehicle at even a regular speed can reach one of these two places from the other in less than 30 minutes assuming that the accused was in talic oroquieta city on march 14 1996 having allegedly had  sic  a drinking spree with dioscoro tado between 700 oclock to 1030 more or less in the evening as he wants the court to believe there was no physical impossibility for him to be at the scene of the crime in san juan panaon misamis occidental at about 1045 pm  this court has ruled consistently that alibi is an inherently weak defenseand should be rejected when the identity of the accused is sufficiently and positively established by the prosecutionmoreover for alibi to overcome the prosecutions evidence the defense must successfully prove the element of physical impossibility of the accuseds presence at the crime scene at the time of the perpetration of the offensephysical impossibility in relation to alibi takes into consideration not only the geographical distance between the scene of the crime and the place where accused maintains he was but more importantly the accessibility between these pointsin this case the element of physical impossibility of appellants presence that fateful night at the crime scene has not been established  
homicide, the conviction of the appellant stemmed from an information reading as follows   that on or about the 24th day of june 1994 in the municipality of babatngon province of leyte philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with deliberate intent to kill and with treachery and evident premeditation did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault stab and wound one bonifacio caysido with a   pisaw   with which said accused had provided himself for the purpose thereby causing and inflicting upon the said bonifacio caysido a fatal wound on his body which caused his death shortly thereafter the testimonies of said prosecution witnesses may be summed as follows rogelio caysido the 21 year old son of the victim testified that the appellant stabbed his father with a knife locally known as pisaw at their house in barangay san ricardo babatngon leyte on the evening of 24 june 1994 according to rogelio he knew appellant as the latter was their neighbor whose house was only a meter away from theirsthat night appellant was in their house drinking rogelio witnessed the stabbing of his father as he was 3 to 4 meters away when the fatal incident took place appellant then fled to the house of his sisterinlaw rogelio cried for help and was aided by several men from their barangay his father was then rushed to the st pauls hospital where eleven  11  days later he succumbed to the mortal wound receivedvictoria caysido the victims wife testified that on june 24 1994 the caysido family was at home celebrating the feast day of st johnaccording to victoria appellant stabbed her husband at the yard of their house and that aside from her husband the appellant and herself there were no other people around when the incident happenedon cross examination however she admitted that she did not witness the stabbing incidentand that she was actually inside the house when someone informed her that her husband had just been stabbed in their own yard as a consequence of her husbands death she was left feeling pain which in terms of moral damages she could quantify in the amount of p5000000 her husbands hospital bills amounted to p8000000 with p1500000 still left unpaid when she testifiedbecause of the unpaid hospital bills victoria was unable to secure her husbands death certificatethe prosecution submitted in evidence the medicolegal report issued by dr florentino merins despite the absence of the testimony of a medicolegal the contents of the same were admitted by the defense without objection the medical certificate reveals that ventura   expired intra operative   on july 5 1994 or while he was undergoing such medical procedures as exploratory laparotomy and gastrorrhaphy  sic  bonifacio sustained a stab wound that penetrated his thoracoabdominal cavity diaphragm   tail of the pancreas colon  splenic flexure    and the stomach where there was massive spillage of gastric and colonic content he also had an incised wound in his armappellant took the witness stand and claimed selfdefense appellant a thirtyfour year old farmer testified that on june 24 1994 at around 900 in the evening he was headed home when he decided to pass by the caysido household he went there to ask bonifacio caysido to   tune their karaoke softly   to which the latter acceded he then proceeded home at around 1100 that evening the caysidos karaoke was once again blaring appellant instructed his son to go next door and request that the volume be toned down as he had to wake up early however instead of granting the request the caysidos turned the karaokes volume full blast appellant also heard victoria shouting that he  appellant  was just envious because he did not have a karaoke appellant decided to go the caysidos to ask them to reduce the volume of the karaoke appellant did not reach the caysido household as he saw the victim bonifacio and his soninlaw danilo josep by the road on their way to the fishpond he approached bonifacio and requested him to please tone down the volume of the karaoke however bonifacio slapped both his ears and uttered   you dont have the right to do the same  sic    the assault caused appellants   sight to dim  just then danilo tried to stab appellant with a knife known as   sipol   but appellant was able to take hold of the weapon danilo thus ran away bonifacio then tried to stab him but appellant succeeded in stabbing bonifacios upper left arm the same thrust hit the latters abdomen appellant thereafter ran to the house of cirilo aporto around sixty  60  meters away he just stood in front of aportos house until some tanod members told him to go inside the house that same night he surrendered to the authorities and was detained for four days he was then released because no complaint was filed against himwhile appellant pleaded not guilty to the crime charged he admitted clearly and categorically that he stabbed bonifacio as an act of selfdefense he disclaimed any legal liability for the act on the ground that his life had been exposed to harm first before he committed the act in defense of himselfin so doing appellant shifted the burden of proof on himself as this court said in people v cario x x x where an accused admits killing the victim but invokes selfdefense it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he acted in selfdefense; and as the burden of the evidence is thus shifted to him he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution for even if the latter were weak it could not be disbelieved after the accuseds open admission of responsibility for the killingthe elements of selfdefense that appellant should prove clearly and convincingly are  1  unlawful aggression on the part of the victim;  2  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the aggression and  3  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himselfto prove selfdefense appellant presented a sole witness – himself hence the resolution of appellants guilt or innocence rests much upon the credibility of his testimony under the law on evidence to be credible testimonial evidence should not only come from the mouth of a credible witness it should also be credible reasonable and in accord with human experienceit should be such that under the common experience and observation of mankind the testimony in question would lead to no other inference than its probability under the circumstances this holds true especially in cases where there is no test by which to determine its veracity except its conformity to our knowledge observation and experienceappellant declared that when he requested bonifacio to tone down the volume of the karaoke the latter allegedly slapped him on the ears thereafter danilo joseph  soninlaw of the deceased  tried to stab appellant who grappled with joseph for possession of the knife after five  5  minutes of struggle appellant was able to wrest the knife from joseph it was allegedly at this juncture that bonifacio pulled his own knife and tried to stab appellant who in an act to selfdefense fatally struck bonifacio with the knife that he took away from joseph thus appellant testified on crossexamination q you testified on direct examination that you were able to get hold the possession of the knife or sipol as you called it from danilo joseph how long did you grapple and got hold the possession of the knife  sic  a about five minutes sir q and while you were grappling with danilo joseph for the possession of the knife bonifacio caysido was within the vicinity a yes q and within that five minutes when you were grappling with danilo joseph bonifacio did not do anything a when i was able to grab the knife known as sipol from danilo joseph bonifacio delivered a stabbing thrust towards me so that i had to deliver a stabbing thrust in return to bonifacio q while within that period while you were grappling with danilo joseph bonifacio caysudo  sic  the victim was not able to stab you as a matter of fact you were not wounded in that incident a no sir i only said   kay ano maisog kagud   are you really brave q so that when you were able to get hold the possession  sic  of the knife of danilo joseph you could have ran instead of stabbing bonifacio because bonifacio never touched you while you were in the possession of the sipol a he draw his knife too q are you trying to impress this court that bonifacio caysido draw his knife when you had already in your possession of the knife of danilo joseph his soninlaw  sic  a yes q but during the five minutes that your were grappling for the possession of the knife of danilo joseph bonifacio did not stab you a not yet x x x q when you saw danilo joseph pulled  sic  out his knife did it not occur to you to run instead of holding the possession of the knife  sic  a no sir because i could not run i was in between them and the fence and you were able to get hold the possession  sic  of the knife of danilo joseph before bonifacio caysido allegedly made a stabbing thrust to you did it not occur to you to run to avoid the confrontation after being hit on my head `as indicated by the witness by meeting his both hands or palms rather on his ears i lost my right senses q who is bigger than you a danilo joseph is bigger than i do q also in physical built a yes q how about you and bonifacio caysido who is bigger than you  sic  a i am taller but he was bigger q and you are trying to impress this court that these two men danilo joseph and bonifacio caysido were bigger than you in physical built not both of them with a knife and you were not stabbed by both of them in that incident a they had weapon with them after i was able to hit one of them i ran away q but it was danilo joseph who first ran away a yes q and you ran away only after you were able to stab the bigger physical built  sic  bonifacio caysido a yes  appellants testimony lacks the ring of truth it is incredible that during the fiveminute struggle between appellant and joseph for possession of the knife the victim just stood by doing nothing to help his soninlaw it was only when appellant who was tubercular was able to take hold of the knife and after danilo ran away leaving his fatherinlaw when the victim pulled a knife and lunged at appellant moreover since both the victim and his soninlaw were bigger than appellant it is most unlikely that he could repel their assault and come out unscathed as correctly assessed by the trial court human experience dictates that the victim would not have waited until appellant was in possession of josephs knife before attempting to attack appellant if the victim had the intention to harm appellant the most opportune time to do so would have been when appellant and joseph were grappling for possession of the latters knife and appellant was at his weakest

the evening when the police and rolando cardel arrived to fetch himappellant rolando cardel claimed that the stabbing incident was already finished when he arrived in bagong nayon valenzuela metro manila from the hospital at 730 oclock in the evening on august 12 1991 appellant arnold calumpang also claimed that he was inside the house of his aunt in bagong nayon after he was robbed of his personal belongings by three  3  persons at around 630 oclock in the evening and remained therein until 730 oclock in the evening in effect the appellants seek refuge under the defense of alibi to escape responsibility for the killing of noel rioflorido jr it must be emphasized that aside from being inherently weak the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the appellants by the prosecution witnessesprosecution witness willy conde was buying some cigarettes at aling dignas store in bagong nayon valenzuela metro manila when noel rioflorido jr was stabbed in front of the store just about two  2  arms length away prosecution witness elmer olesco was sitting in front of the said store drinking coke when the stabbing incident occurred both prosecution witnesses categorically declared that they saw calumpang punched rioflorido jr on the right side of the face and that thereafter rolando cardel held the victim in the nape and stabbed him at the back on the right side of his body they saw the incident clearly for the reason that the premises was welllighted by an electric bulb in front of aling dignas storethe respective testimonies of the two  2  prosecution witnesses do not suffer from any serious and material contradictions that can detract from their credibility the trial court gave full faith and credence to the respective testimonies of prosecution witnesses willy conde and elmer olesco as against those of the appellants the defense did not dispute the presence of the said prosecution witnesses in front of aling dignas store in bagong nayon valenzuela metro manila when the stabbing incident occurred the defense likewise failed to adduce adequate evidence to establish any improper motive that may have impelled the same witnesses to falsely testify against the appellants the bare allegation of the defense that the prosecution witnesses willy conde and elmer olesco and the victim noel rioflorido jr were members of a fraternity is too shallow and does not deserve even a scant consideration it is wellsettled rule that the evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect because such court has the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and determine if they are telling the truth or nothowever this court finds itself unable to agree with the trial court that conspiracy existed in this case under article 8 of the revised penal code a conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it likewise there is conspiracy if at the time of the commission of the offense the appellants had the same purpose and were united in its executionit appears that appellant arnold calumpang was divested of his wristwatch necklace and wallet by three  3  unidentified persons while he was on his way to visit his aunt in bagong nayon valenzuela metro manila subsequently noel rioflorido jr was apprehended by appellant rolando cardel and other concerned citizens in bagong nayon as suspect in the snatching of calumpangs personal belongings the prosecution failed to establish that appellants cardel and calumpang came to an agreement to kill rioflorido jr nor any such agreement may be deduced from the manner in which the offense was committed; or from the acts of the appellants before during and after the commission of the crime indubitably pointing to and indicating a joint purpose concert of action and a community of interestthe evidence shows that appellant cardel and the concerned citizens were on their way to bring noel rioflorido jr to the bantay bayan headquarters in bagong nayon when the latter resisted arrest and attempted to escape prosecution witness willy conde testified on direct examination that when appellant cardel stabbed rioflorido jr appellant calumpang had already fled from the scene of the crime to wit fiscal at the time that cardel stabbed jun what was arnold doing a he ran away sir q you mean he was not around when cardel stabbed noel a yes sir q so you are saying that arnold after boxing jun had already left or immediately ran away a yes and then rolando stabbed him sir q so when jun was stabbed only rolando cardel was there a yes sirthere is no basis for the conclusion of the trial court   that both accused took the law into their own hands by practically executing noel rioflorido jr xxx in conspiracy with each other   it should be pointed out that apppellant calumpang could not have assented nor actively cooperated in the killing of the victim for the reason that he was no longer at the scene of the crime when appellant cardel stabbed rioflorido jr the existence of conspiracy is never presumed it is axiomatic that the prosecution must establish conspiracy beyond reasonable doubthence the appellants will be separately adjudged according to the extent of their individual participation in the commission of the crime charged in the information

across the pub house a while later emma saw gabuyan collared by pat romarate who was with heracleo and gregorio duay approached romarate identifying himself as a manu agent romarate ignored him and handcuffed both duay and gabuyan the two were then dragged into the groups vehicle emma immediately reported what she saw to the office of the manu several days later at the anticrime unit office she positively identified romarate heracleo and gregorio from pictures provided by the investigator as the persons who seized duay and gabuyan ramon de asis was watching television at home on the night of 12 january 1990 when he saw four persons in the vicinity of his house one of them already dead he did not see the face of the dead person which was   lying face down   but he recognized heracleo and

regarding the death of duay and gabuyan after they were apprised of their constitutional rights heracleo and gregorio told him they did not need the assistance of a lawyer and they were willing to give a statement nevertheless rodel called atty rideway tanjili assistant regional attorney of the public assistance office  pao  to assist them in signing a sworn statement waiving their rights to counsel and to remain silent atty tanjili substantially corroborated this point on 19 february 1990 heracleo and gregorio executed an extrajudicial confession in the presence of fiscal garcia wherein they narrated their participation in the commission of the crime dr jose ladrido jr a medicolegal officer testified that he conducted an autopsy on the cadavers of duay and gabuyan on 15 january 1990

of both heracleo and romarate at bankerohan davao city testified that on 12 january 1990 hermina herrera told him to see her commonlaw husband romarate later gregorio and heracleo met romarate who was having a drinking session with butong and dida dae rolando corsolado and herrera at about 700 pm romarate and his group stopped drinking he asked gregorio to accompany him in a buybust operation to be conducted at 5m drug store gregorio and heracleo went with romarate corsonado butong dae and herrera romarate tried to buy at the rose pharmacy a drug know as   pidol   which he described as an appetizer but failed so he proceeded to the 5m drug store again romarate was not given the drug heracleo offered to buy the drug after being assured by romarate that there was nothing to worry about having bought the drug heracleo crossed the street toward his companions but was arrested by gabuyan upon seeing the incident romarate with a drawn gun approached gabuyan and ordered the latter to release heracleo gabuyan was handcuffed and brought near a theater thereafter romarate went toward duay poked a gun at him and frisked him for weapons a gun tucked in duays waist was confiscated by romarate duay and gabuyan were brought to the residence of heracleo where gregorio watched romarate corsonado and butong dae tie the hands of duay and gabuyan with wires and gag their mouths with handkerchiefs to prevent them from shouting meanwhile heracleo left to play basketball gregorio further testified that at about 1000 pm gabuyan and duay were brought near the river situated 15 meters from heracleos house he saw romarate corsonado and butong dae take turns in repeatedly stabbing the two he could not run away because romarates gun was pointed at him romarate even ordered heracleo to shoot duay whose body was thrown into the river heracleo only fired a shot into the air a while later ramon de asis arrived and was told by romarate that the victims were killed because they were members of the npa after the incident gregorio and heracleo still saw each other while romarate corsonado and butong dae avoided them at one time they decided to seek the aid of heracleos mother pedrita manriquez so that they could surrender to the proper authorities and   to know who is at fault   on 17 february 1990 gregorio and heracleo surrendered to police officer teodoro paguiducon gregorio alleged that during investigation he was not informed of his rights to counsel and to remain silent he denied having admitted before the national police commission that he had any participation in the killing of the victims for his part heracleo asserted that he had no participation in the killing of gabuyan and duay his testimony mostly corroborated that of gregorio concerning the incident of 12 january 1990 he confirmed that he and gregorio voluntarily surrendered to the police on 17 february 1990 and that they executed a sworn statement at the residence of atty tanjili on the latters promise that they would not be implicated in the crime but instead be utilized as state witnesses their story was corroborated by pedrita manriquez and officer teodoro paguiducon gregorio maintains that the oral admission and extrajudicial confession he gave before the police authorities cannot be used as evidence against him because his waiver of his rights to remain silent and to counsel during custodial interrogation cannot be characterized as one made knowingly voluntarily and intelligently since  1  the sworn statement was written in english and there was no proof that the preliminary questions and answers therein were translated much less a translation after every question and answer in his alleged waiver into the visayancebuano dialect a language spoken and understood by him;  2  there was no proof that he then only 18 years old and a 4th grader clearly understood the import and consequences of the waiver which was   couched in broad and general terms  ;  3  the sworn statement related only to his alleged disinterest to be represented by a counsel but it did not signify an agreement to make a confession of the crime with which he was charged;  4  he executed the sworn statement not knowing that an extrajudicial confession was attached thereto and;  5  the presence of his mother during the signing of the waiver did not guarantee that the same was done voluntarily and intelligently likewise gregorio vehemently denies the existence of a conspiracy in the commission of the felony he argues that conceding that he dutifully followed the orders of romarate it was only because the latter was a police officer and armed while he was not a minor and in no position to dispute or oppose the orders of romarate apart from his extrajudicial confession which became the sole basis for the trial courts judgment of conviction there was no proof that a conspiracy existed in blatant disregard of the rule that independent evidence and proof beyond reasonable doubt are required in order to establish a conspiracy the records show that the document of waiver  exh f    signed by gregorio was prepared on 7 february 1990 but was subscribed and sworn to on 19 february 1990 before asst city prosecutor jose garcia

them some food stuff he arrived in the afternoon and saw his nephew jovino flores who was there on a vacation his daughter sonia informed him that the graduation of oscar and elisa would be held on march 25 1994 two days after or on march 21 1994 luter sr went back to suaon to get money upon reaching home his wife told him that oscar was killed and that luter sr and his three sons were being

coaccused remain at large luter srs daughter sonia and his nephew jovino flores corroborated his testimony there is no dispute that there was no eyewitness to the actual killing of the victim oscar caldoza however several circumstances lead to the conclusion that luter sr was one of the perpetrators of the crime first it is not disputed that bad blood exists between the caldozas and the orculas because of a boundary dispute over the land that they respectively own second two months before the incident the wife of luter sr had warned the wife of oscar that the formers son nestor orcula has a plan to kill oscarthis is not necessarily hearsay if only to prove that there was such a statement or warning made and true enough the warning was not just an empty threat because oscar was indeed

and junior chasing his grandfather and that they later went to the house of polinar jr and inquired about his father and unclefourth prosecution witness alimasac testified that he was on his way home that night when he saw the four accused standing on the road around thirty  30  meters away from where the body of oscar was found buried and that he noticed that junior was carrying a spadethe following morning the same spade was found near the gravesite alimasac positively identified the spade as the one belonging to the orculas because of the handle aside from the fact that he used to see it at the house of the latterfifth polinar jr testified that he saw nestor carrying a bolo as their group was surrounding oscar the sanitary inspector who conducted a postmortem examination on oscar testified that the stab and hack wounds sustained by the latter were caused by a bolosixth the last time that polinar jr saw oscar alive was when the latter was running towards oscars house being chased by the orculas the following day the body of oscar was found buried 100 meters away from his house seventh the three other accused  junior lando and nestor  are the children of luter sr who remain to be at large surprisingly no one from the immediate family seems to know their whereabouts and no sufficient explanation has been offered as to their flight defense witness sonia cujitia a daughter of luter sr admitted that her brothers disappeared right after the incident and that she does not know where they areit has often been said that flight is a strong indication of guiltluter sr was seen together with his three sons during all the times material to this case when polinar jr saw the orculas gang up on oscar a few meters away from the formers house; when the same group went to the house of polinar jr and asked the latter about his father and uncle; and when alimasac met the group on the road several meters away from where the body of oscar was found there is no iota of doubt that luter sr conspired with his three sons in the killing of oscar accusedappellant claims that on march 20 1994 he was at pamakawon asuncion davao to visit his children accusedappellant admits that it takes only six  6  hours to travel from suaon to pamakawon thus it was not physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission  
homicide, the accusatory portion of the information reads as follows that on or about the 5th day of november 1995 in the evening in osmena avenue municipality of kalibo province of aklan republic of the philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused while armed with wooden stall and knife conspiring confederating and helping one another with treachery and evident premeditation and with intent to kill did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault strike and stab one ricky deslate thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal wounds    x x x x x x x x x contrary to law prosecution witness regie diapo testified that at around 1045 pm on the evening of november 5 1995 she was watching over the store of annie quimpo at the ceres bus terminal on osmena avenue kalibo aklan when eddie danny and tony arrived with three women for some refreshments at midnight ricky deslate who was the conductor for the 230 am trip entered the store by himself intending to get his uniform but was prevented from doing so due to the commotion which erupted eddie hit ricky with a wooden stool at the back of his neck while the latters arms were being held down by danny and tony reeling from the blow ricky lost his balance and fell to the ground immediately after danny also using a stool delivered another blow which landed above the victims nose regie testified that she did not observe tonys participation in the attack furthermore she admitted that she could not testify on why the fighting began not having heard any arguments between the victim and the accused before the altercation when the fighting started the three women who were with the accused ran from the store; the accused themselves fled from the terminal after their attack leaving ricky lying on the floor regie shouted for help and looked for a tricycle to take ricky to the hospital with the assistance of diomedel diapo and ronald heradora the victim was brought to the hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival dr landelino menez who conducted the autopsy and prepared the death certificate described the cause of death as   cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to severe hypovolemia secondary to stabbed wound   in the medicolegal report dr menez noted that the victim sustained the following injuries  1  a stab wound left anterior chest level of the 6th  7th intercostal space penetrating the thoracic cavity and bisecting the heart and  2  a lacerated wound approximately two  2  centimeters in the occipital area according to dr menez the first wound was fatal not satisfied with the autopsy conducted by dr menez the prosecution had the victims body reexamined by dr renato bautista a medicolegal expert from the national bureau of investigation based on his examination of the cadaver dr bautista noted the following wounds  1  hematoma on the occipital region of the scalp measuring 6 by 7 centimeters;  2  hematoma on the nape measuring 5 to 6 centimeters;  3  chip fracture on the left side of the victims nasal bone and  4  stab wound located on the left side of the chest penetrating the heart in his opinion the hematomas were probably inflicted by a blunt instrument while the victim was still alive whereas the fracture on the nasal bone was most likely caused by a strong and direct blow with the use of ones fists or a blunt object such as a piece of wood it is very likely that such injuries rendered the victim unconscious and immobile diomedel diapo substantially corroborated regie diapos testimony he claimed that on november 5 1995 at around 11 pm he was with ricky deslate and some other friends at a fair after leaving the fair at 1130 pm diomedel proceeded to his house which is located right across the ceres terminal to eat his supper while ricky and the others went their own separate ways at around midnight diomedel heard shouts coming from the direction of the terminal prodding him to walk across the street to see what was going on from where he stood  a distance of about five meters from the accused and the victim  diomedel observed practically the same incidents as those seen by his sister regie he saw  1  rickys arms being held down by danny and tony and eddie hitting him with a stool at the back of the neck and a few seconds after  2  danny hitting ricky in between the eyes with another stool diomedel remarked that he heard a cracking sound when danny delivered the blow also diomedel testified that he saw tony stab ricky after they had finished attacking the victim the accused together with their female companions ran away from the bus terminal towards the intersection of osme avenue and quezon avenue diomedel brought ricky to the hospital in a tricycle called by regie; afterwards he proceeded to the house of rickys parents to tell them about what had happened danny eddie vivian adoc and jocelyn adoc testified for the defense expectedly the version of the defense varied substantially from that of the prosecution eddie claimed that he acted in selfdefense he explained that while he was eating at the ceres terminal together with his brothers danny and tony vivian adoc  wife of danny  nita adoc  wife of tony  and jocelyn adoc  niece of the adoc brothers  three men armed with knives approached their group one of these men was ricky whom eddie recognized because he often saw him whenever he would go to the bus terminal without any provocation coming from the group of the accused ricky uttered to eddie   kawgid ro siga iya      you are behaving like a tough guy here    when eddie asked him what he had done ricky boxed eddies right cheek immediately after one of rickys companions boxed eddie on his left cheek noticing that ricky was about to stab him eddie picked up a wooden stool and hit ricky on the back of the head and then he ran outside the terminal however when he saw that ricky was still following him he stopped and hit him again with the stool which blow landed between the victims eyes eddie maintained that at the beginning of the altercation tony and his wife nita were standing outside the terminal waiting for a tricycle when tony saw ricky chasing after eddie tony stabbed ricky during this entire period rickys companions although both armed with knives and standing beside the victim did not help him nor use their weapons in his defense eddie also claimed that ricky himself had already drawn his own knife from his scabbard and held it in his left hand and yet never used it against him for his part danny vigorously denied any participation in the attack he asserted that when ricky boxed eddie his pregnant wife hugged him and they ran from the terminal towards calachuchi road where they hid for twenty minutes before eventually heading home as asserted by eddie danny also maintained that when ricky and his companions arrived tony was standing outside the terminal with his wife waiting for a tricycle up until the time danny and his wife ran out of the terminal vivian adoc dannys wife testified that on the evening of november 5 1995 they brought their niece jocelyn adoc to the ceres terminal since she intended to catch the first bus ride home to iloilo the following day as they were eating their snacks at one of the terminals stores and quietly conversing among themselves three men arrived one of whom accosted and boxed eddie under the right ear she later identified this man as the victim following suit one of rickys companions also boxed eddie but on the opposite cheek ricky and the two men with him were armed with knives not wanting her husband to get involved in a fight vivian hugged danny in order to prevent him from helping his brother; danny and her then ran from the terminal after hiding in calachuchi road danny and her went directly to their house and shortly after eddie arrived when the fray began tony and nita were across the road waiting for a tricycle; however they never showed up at the house that night and have not been heard from since the time of the incidentfinally the defense presented its last witness  jocelyn adoc who essentially confirmed the testimonies of the other defense witnesses she testified that on the evening of november 5 1995 she met danny eddie tony vivian and nita at the fair and that they all accompanied her to the ceres bus terminal so that she could inquire about the bus schedule for iloilo upon reaching the terminal rickys group already was already drinking on the side of the road jocelyn asserted that she saw ricky threaten and box eddie after which eddie hit ricky with the stool twice she then fled the terminal and ran towards the direction of cervatos with the two companions of ricky chasing after her until a gasoline station about fifty meters away from the terminal however on crossexamination jocelyn stated that she was not certain that the persons who chased her were the two men who arrived with ricky at the terminal jocelyn reiterated the statements made by the other defense witnesses regarding the locations of danny tony and their spouses at the time the fighting started  tony and nita were waiting for a tricycle outside the terminal whereas danny and vivian ran away after eddie was boxed according to jocelyn the two men with ricky also chased danny and his wife out of the terminal but immediately after jocelyn declared that she was in fact not sure who chased her uncle and aunt the defenses version of events meanwhile was rejected by the trial court as being unworthy of credit for several reasons first of all eddies assertions  that after he had hit ricky on the nape and on his nose which blows resulted in a hematoma and a fracturing of the victims nasal bone the latter still chased him for a distance of about twenty  20  meters  were directly contradicted by the expert testimony of dr bautista who explained that such injuries were sufficient to render the victim unconscious immobile and unable to defend himself secondly if ricky and his two companions in fact had knives it is difficult to believe that they never used it in the course of the altercation also eddie could not display any physical injuries which he sustained as a result of the alleged assault by ricky and his companion finally in view of the close familial ties characteristic of philippine culture dannys claim that he did not help his brother eddie was incredulous in essence the trial court rejected eddies claim that he acted in selfdefense and dannys denial of any participation in the killing holding that the testimonies of the defense witnesses were not supported by credible evidence it declared that evidence to be worthy of credit must not only proceed from a credible source but must be credible in itself finding that the accused acted in conspiracy the following acts were cited by the court as evincing a   joint purpose and design concerted action and community of interest   among the accused  1  danny and tony held ricky to enable eddie to strike at him;  2  danny immediately delivered another blow upon the victim; and  3  tony stabbed the victim who had been rendered helpless by the two previous blows eddie claims that when he saw that ricky was about to stab him he hit the latter with a stool; still ricky chased him causing eddie to hit ricky a second time which blow was delivered with such force that it resulted in a fracturing of the victims nasal bone despite the fact that the victim had already sustained two very direct blows to his head and face eddie insists that ricky continued to chase him all the way out of the terminal at which point tony stabbed the victim however according to dr bautista the nbi medicolegal expert the blow sustained by the victim on his head and on his nasal bone were at the very least sufficient to make him dizzy but more likely rendered him unconscious and unable to move in such a state ricky was certainly in no condition to give chase like the trial court we are more inclined to believe the testimony of regie diapo that after ricky was hit on the back of the head by eddie he lost his balance and fell to the ground in this position it would have been very easy for danny to deliver the second blow and for tony to stab the victim moreover if the version of the defense is to be believed ricky and his two companions who were both standing beside ricky during the altercation were all armed with knives; in fact according to eddie at the time ricky boxed him the latter was clutching his knife in his left hand the accused further testified that they had no weapons and were outnumbered by ricky and his two companions since tony was standing outside the terminal at the time given this situation it is incredible that the victims group did not even once make use of their knives in attacking the accused if such was indeed their intention and that rickys comrades did not come to his aid during the entire duration of the attack in utter contradiction of the defenses narration of events it is revealing that it was still ricky who sustained all the injuries despite his groups alleged superiority in number and arms; whereas eddie and danny escaped totally unscathed danny claimed that when ricky boxed eddie he ran away because his pregnant wife did not want him to get into trouble we cannot believe that danny would abandon his brother at the moment the latter was allegedly assaulted by a stranger in a recent case we explained that it is natural for brothers to   close in fraternal ranks   in mauling the victim since such conduct is more characteristic of the closeness among filipino siblings following the defenses theory it makes no sense that the accused did not inform the authorities of the events which transpired that evening of november 5 1995 it is the natural reaction of one who has witnessed or has himself been the victim of a crime to reveal it to the authorities unless of course he is the author thereof if danny and eddie were truly the victims rather than the aggressors of an unprovoked offensive coming from rickys group they should have been eager to explain their side to the police in order to clear their names and eliminate any suspicions as to the nature and extent of their participation in the fray but they did not after the fracas eddie and danny went to the latters house neither of them reported the incident to the police whether immediately after the incident or at any time thereafter tony and nita on the other hand were never seen or heard from since the incident flight in jurisprudence has always been a strong indication of guilt betraying a desire to evade responsibility the three accused together with danny and tonys pregnant wives went to the ceres bus terminal on the night of november 5 1995 to inquire about the bus schedule for their niece jocelyn adoc who was planning to leave for iloilo the following day the meeting with ricky took place solely by chance when ricky entered the bus terminal to get his conductors uniform there is no evidence that the accused had any intention of picking a fight with much less of killing the victim herein the altercation which erupted between the accused and the victim was spontaneous which militates against a finding that the accused deliberately adopted a specific mode of attack to insure the execution of the crime without risk to themselves the prosecutions own evidence shows that the accused were eating and enjoying a relaxed conversation at one of the stores inside the terminal immediately before the fight commenced regie diapo testified as follows  q before 1200 midnight of november 5 1995 do you also remember if there were also people arrived in that store of annie quimpo a yes sir q to the best of your recollection how many women a three  3  q how many men a three  3  q and what did they do at the store of annie quimpo a they drunk q what did they drink a beer q what about these three  3  women you mentioned a they had snacks x x x x x x x x x q and these three adocs had been drinking from the time they arrived at around 1045 until the incident happened a yes sir q so when the incident happened they were still there at the table drinking a yes your honor [] the table in front q you mean to say the table in front which is nearest the buses of the ceres a the tables were placed along side the buses q so the drinking of the three adocs were interrupted by the incident a yes your honor x x x x x x x x x q miss diapo before the incident these three adocs were drinking as well as their three companions were also at the store eating snacks these three adocs were drinking quietly with each other a they were conversing to each other court q and they were not behaving in an unruly manner a they were talking and they were joking and they were laughing x x x x x x x x x diomeded diapo corroborated regie diapos testimony; he declared that about thirty minutes before the fighting began the accused were happily conversing with each other we also take note of the fact that the two eyewitnesses admitted to not knowing why or how the fighting began regie dipao testified thus q now did you hear of any arguments between ricky and these danny and eddie adoc before you saw the striking incident a i did not hear q and you did not also hear of any screams from the 3 women companions of tony adoc and eddie adoc before you saw that striking incident a i did not x x x x x x x x x q and the first time you noticed the incident was when the two adocs danny and tony were holding ricky a yes your honor q but before that you do not know or you were not aware of what made danny and tony holding ricky and then eddie was striking him a yes your honor q why where were you before that you did not notice what happened a because i was at the cashiers booth with the goods in front of me q and what made you noticed them at that time a because of the noise and ricky was already struggling q why what were you doing behind the cashiers booth a i was sitting you honor q when you heard the noise what did you do a we stood up q and when you stood up what happened a that was the time that i saw ricky was hit x x x x x x x x x neither could diomedel diapo testify as to the cause of the fray he came out of his house which was across the terminal only after he already heard shouts which proves that the fighting had already started when he arrived at the scene of the crime this failure of the prosecution to present evidence as to the manner in which the altercation started precludes a finding that the killing was qualified by treachery  
homicide, the information against accusedappellant alleged that on or about the 20th day of november 1994 in the city of tacloban philippines within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with deliberate intent and with intent to kill and with treachery and evident premeditation armed with a bladed weapon  fan knife  did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault stab and wound one teodolfo ramirez on his chest thereby inflicting upon said teodolfo ramirez stab wounds which caused his deaththe prosecution presented evidence showing the following at around 730 in the morning of november 20 1994 julian rama who was in the front yard of his house in barangay 80 marasbaras tacloban city saw accusedappellant francisco caber sr chasing teodolfo ramirez with a bladed weapon locally known as pisao rama knew both because caber was his fellow barangay tanod while ramirez was his kumpadre the latter ran towards him asking for help rama said he raised his hands as he told caber   pare dont come near us    but his plea was not heeded although ramirez sought cover behind rama accusedappellant was able to stab him  ramirez  twice on the chest rama called on his neighbors to help but they got scared and fled accusedappellant surrendered to rama who instructed another tanod to take accusedappellant to the city police stationrama and still another companion took ramirez to the tacloban city hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival the attending physician dr leo b lagado issued the following medicolegal report  exh b  dated october 3 1995 stab wound about 1cm in length midsternal area at the level of the nipple penetrating the left thoracic cavity stab wound about 2cm in length left parasternal area 1st intercestal space penetrating the left thoracic cavity     remarks dead on arrival at hospital emergency roomdr lagado testified that the victim died of hypovolemic shock secondary to the stab wounds he opined that the stab wounds were caused by a bladed weapon possibly by the fan knife locally known as pisao the two stab wounds were fatal and the one in the midsternal area which penetrated the victims left thoracic cavity by itself could have caused the death of ramirezaccusedappellant testified in his behalf he admitted killing ramirez but he claimed that he did so in selfdefense he declared that he was 63 years old married and that he worked at the mercados caltex gasoline station in front of the divine word university in tacloban city he claimed that at around 730 in the morning of november 20 1994 he took a pedicab to work just after he had alighted from the vehicle he heard someone shout   manong caber someone is going to kill you    instinctively he turned around and caught ramirez hand as the latter was about to stab him accusedappellant said he was able to parry the blow turn the knife towards his attacker and thrust it to the latters chest accusedappellant claimed that ramirez then ran towards ramas house; that he gave chase; and that after catching up with ramirez he stabbed the latter on the chest once thereafter he surrendered to a barangay tanod at the police outpost near the city hospital and was detained at the tacloban city jailaccusedappellant claimed that his wife adelina caber had filed a rape case on november 18 1994 against the deceased as a result of which ramirez was arrested and detained he said that prior to the stabbing incident he did not know that ramirez had been released from jail he denied having harbored any grudge against the victim for what the latter had done to his wifeadelina caber corroborated her husbands testimony that on november 18 1994 she filed a complaint for rape against ramirez for which reason he was arrested and detained at the city jail on the same day asked whether her husband harbored any grudge against accusedappellant adelina caber said that her husband merely told her that he was not going to harm her if she told everything to himfirst accusedappellant claims he acted in selfdefense in killing ramirez he contends that the prosecution witness julian rama witnessed only the second stage of his encounter with ramirez ie when he chased ramirez and stabbed him but the initial aggression was actually committed by ramirez by attacking himthis contention has no merit to begin with by invoking selfdefense accusedappellant admits to the crime for which he is charged and therefore it becomes incumbent upon him to prove  a  that the victim was guilty of unlawful aggression;  b  that there was reasonable necessity for the means employed by him to repel the aggression; and  c  that there was sufficient provocation on his  accusedappellants  partproof of the first requirement  unlawful aggression of the victim  is indispensable since the theory of selfdefense is based on the necessity on the part of the person being attacked to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression even if initially there was unlawful aggression the person attacked has no more right to kill or wound the former aggressor the moment the aggression ceases when the danger or risk to him has disappeared there should be a corresponding cessation of hostilities on the part of the person defending himselfin the case at bar the evidence for the prosecution shows that accusedappellant ran after and then stabbed ramirez twice hitting him on the chest as the latter tried to seek cover behind rama this circumstance negates the presence of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim accusedappellant claims that it was ramirez who initially attacked him with a knife assuming this to be true it would nonetheless appear that ramirezs unlawful aggression had already ceased when he was stabbed by accusedappellant because by the latters own account ramirez ran away after accusedappellant turned the knife toward him and thrust it to him if accusedappellants claim is to be believed ramirez was already running away but accusedappellant still pursued him there was clearly no longer any danger to accusedappellant in people v alcongathe alleged aggressor after being wounded ran away but the accused nevertheless pursued and then mortally wounded him this court rejected the plea of selfdefense and held that after the victim had already fled the accuseds right to inflict injury upon the assailant ceasedaccusedappellants defense is further weakened by his failure to present any corroborating evidence he claimed that without provocation ramirez tried to stab him with a knife as he was alighting from a pedicab but he was able to ward off the attack because of the timely warning given by a bystander it was therefore necessary for him to present the pedicab driver or the person who warned him to corroborate his testimony his failure to do so puts in doubt his credibility second the foregoing notwithstanding accusedappellants contention that the prosecution failed to prove the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery is meritorious evident premeditation cannot be appreciated against accusedappellant because the prosecution failed to establish  a  the time when accusedappellant determined to commit the crime;  b  an act manifestly indicating that he had clung to his determination; and  c  a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and the execution to allow him the opportunity to reflect upon the consequences of his act and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution of his willthe only evidence presented by the prosecution to prove this circumstance is that ramirezs wife charged accusedappellant with rape but this alone is insufficient to show that because of this fact accusedappellant premeditated on his revenge against ramirez nor can the qualifying circumstance of treachery be appreciated against accusedappellant treachery exists when the offender commits any of the crimes against person employing means methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might maketo prove treachery the prosecution must show  a  that at the time of the attack the victim was not in a position to defend himself and  b  that the accused consciously adopted the particular means method or form of attack employed by himin the case at bar the fact that accusedappellant chased ramirez and then stabbed him as the latter tried to seek cover behind rama precisely shows that ramirez knew the danger facing him and he tried to escape from it albeit unsuccessfully under such circumstances there can be no treachery accusedappellant testified that when he dealt the victim a second blow rama was holding the victims hands the victims position was accidental accusedappellant could not have consciously or deliberately sought to take advantage of this fact to attack ramirezon the other hand the solicitorgenerals contention that the trial court erred in crediting accusedappellant with the mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation is meritorious this circumstance is considered mitigating because by reason of causes naturally producing in a person powerful excitement he loses his reason and selfcontrol thereby diminishing the exercise of his will powerin order that this circumstance may be appreciated the defense must show  a  an act both unlawful and sufficient to produce such condition of mind; and  b  said act which produced the obfuscation must not be so far removed from the time of commission of the crime because after a considerable length of time the perpetrator might have recovered his equanimityfurthermore it is necessary to show that the passion and obfuscation arose from lawful sentiments and not from a spirit of lawlessness or revengein this case accusedappellant testified that he did not harbor any grudge against ramirez and that he was not aware that the latter had been released from detention on november 20 1994 he was thus surprised when ramirez allegedly attacked him in the morning of that daythese statements coming no less from accusedappellant totally negate his claim of passion or obfuscation on his part even assuming however that he really killed ramirez because of passion or obfuscation in order to avenge the wrong done to his wife by the victim still he cannot be credited with this circumstance as he would then have acted   in the spirit of revenge   furthermore although accusedappellants wife was allegedly raped by ramirez on november 17 1994 the stabbing incident in question took place three days later or on november 20 1994 thus the act which was supposed to have caused passion or obfuscation on the part of the accusedappellant was so far removed from the date of the stabbing in united states v sarikalathe court ruled that the lapse of more than 24 hours reckoned from the commission of the act which produced the passion or obfuscation up to the time of the commission of the felony constituted a considerable period of time after which such circumstance would no longer be deemed present nevertheless accusedappellant should be credited with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender the requisites for this circumstance are  1  the offender has not been actually arrested;  2  the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority; and  3  the surrender must be voluntaryin this case the evidence shows that shortly after stabbing ramirez accusedappellant gave himself up to barangay tanod julian rama who then arranged for his surrender to the city police although a barangay tanod is not a person in authority but only an agent of a person in authoritynevertheless rama could be treated as an intermediary to accusedappellants surrender so as to justify appreciating this mitigating circumstance in favor of accusedappellant

the desk sergeant on duty when cleofe reported the shooting incident at the liloan police station he entered   author unknown person   in the police blotter since he could not establish after interrogating cleofe who jacintos assailant wason crossexamination patrolman necostrato clarified that he placed said entry since cleofe told him that jacinto was   shot by a person whom she did not know and identify  jeovani son of jacinto and moisesa testified that his sister   was inside the fence of  their  house shouting   when their father was shot he on the other hand ran to the side of the house and hid behind a stone when the assailant left he went outside the fence and saw his father   lying down   however he did not see any motorcycle in fact he could not see anything because   it was dark   and   the light on the post was not lighted  on crossexamination jeovani admitted that his sister was nearer the gunman than he was since she was   immediately behind  their  father when he was shot  after the defense presented its evidenceinchief the prosecution recalled cleofe to the witness stand as rebuttal witness cleofe testified that oscar was not arrested at the liloan police station when he ostentatiously submitted himself for interrogation   so that a surveillance  could  be made on his person   and the real killer knownoscar however argues in his appellants brief that cleofe could not have recognized him as the driver of the motorcycle during the five  5  seconds that she claimed to have glanced at him and the gunman while fleeing oscar claims that  1  cleofes view of the driver was obstructed by the gunman who boarded the motorcycle behind the driver;  2  cleofe was facing the backs of the driver and the gunman as they sped off towards cebu city; and that  3  there was no light from the lamppost he cited cleofes testimony as follows atty alo q my question is when you saw the motorcycle for a period of five  5  seconds the situation in the motorcycle was that the rider was there already behind the driver a yes he was already there    q now the motorcycle when you saw it for five  5  seconds was already facing towards cebu city a yes q and there was a motion already the engine was started a yes q and you notice d  it only when the rider sat at the back that is the time you saw the motorcycle a i saw him when he rode the motorcycle when the motorcycle was runningoscar further maintains that witness could not have recognized at that time because the assailant and the driver were facing against her which means that cleofe pepito could not have had a glimpse of the drivers face because he was covered by the trigger man who was then seated at the back of the driver of the motorcycle  cleofe however testified that atty alo q but you must remember that at 830 o clock in the evening it is already night  sic  it is  sic  already very dark is that correct a yes q and because of that even you who is very young can make a mistake of looking at the light that comes across the street towards a person is that correct a i was not mistaken in that because i am so familiar with his face i can recognize him even when his back is turned  witness saying that at the same time pointing to the accused in fact cleofe confirmed that everything that happened that fateful evening of 26 october 1991 was captured like a   photograph  in  her mind  as to the allegation that there was no light at the lamppost a review of the transcript of stenographic notes reveals that cleofe testified that the place where oscar waited with his motorcycle was lighted by a   mercury   bulb from the vulcanizing shop of arnold hernandez she elaborated atty alo do you recall having made an affidavit in connection with your investigation before the fiscals office a i remember having executed an affidavit at the police station at the ramos supermarket q now you remember what you have stated in your affidavit    court answer the question can you still recall what you stated a yes atty alo q now on this important question of identity could you recall if you stated in that affidavit that the light from the vulcanizing shop was the light that caused you to see the motorcycle and the driver a that was not the only light the light coming from the vulcanizing shop was not the only source of light at that time there was a motorcycle vehicle coming or passing by at that time q    now you said that it was the light of arnold hernandezs shop that lighted the motorcycle and the driver when you saw the driver do you recall that a yes    q that is why you made the statement that the light of the vulcanizing plant was the one that lighted the motorcycle is that correct a it was one of the sources of the lightcross examination by atty alo q going back to the subject matter of light you mentioned that there was a light coming from the vulcanizing plant of arnold hernandez this light of arnold is in his shop a yes q while the motorcycle is across the road a yes q so the light involves only a bulb a mercury q and it is under the roof of his house a inside the vulcanizing there is a light but there are also lights in post s  around the shop    q you describe the light what was that again a mercury q similar to the  sic  used by the visayan electric company in the post s  here in cebu city a no sir q you mean to say the light of the visayan electric is much brighter  than  the one used by arnold a the light in the post of the shop of arnold is brighter than the visayan electric q now when you were outside your gate could you tell us how fast was that car passed  sic  the motorcycle during that time a natural q that car was going to the north or to the south a to the north q meaning to say it was proceed ing  to danao a yes q and it was timely when you looked at the motorcycle that car was passing alighted  sic  to  sic  the motorcycle is that correct a yes q the lights of the car hit the motorcycle directly is that correct a it was lightedthe following circumstances based chiefly on jose pepitos testimonywere established by the state 1 jose pepito saw oscar and a companion drinking beer at myrnas store at bo pitogo consolacion cebu in the evening of 26 october 1991 and then leaving towards pagutlan yati liloan on board a motorcycle 2 several minutes later an unidentified man shot jacinto at the gate of his mothers house in pagutlan yati liloan cebu 3 on the road to pagutlan jose pepito heard the shot after which he saw a man run to the other side of the road where another man waited on a motorcycle as soon as the gunman boarded the duo fled 4 jose pepito observed that the men and the motorcycle he had seen at myrnas store were the same persons and motorcycle he saw near arnold hernandezs vulcanizing shop immediately prior and after the shooting pepito saw the gunman and oscar flee on board the motorcycle 5 jose pepito positively identified oscar as the driver of the motorcycle it is also stressed that cleofe reported the shooting incident at the liloan police station some thirty minutes after her declaration disclaiming knowledge of the name of jacintos assailant was not inconsistent with her belated claim that oscar was the driver of the getaway motorcycle cleofes alleged omission is more or less attributable to the fact that her interrogation at the liloan police station centered on the identity of the gunman not on the driver of the motorcycle in any event she testified that she mentioned oscar as the companion of the gunman when she first reported the shooting incident but was uncertain whether her statement was entered in the  police  blotter

provocation canuel stabbed him with a bolo hitting him on the right side of his stomach while bello gave him a fist blow on the face after amadeo had fallen on the ground canuel kicked him bello went into the store where 20 persons had taken shelter from the rain and announced that canuel had stabbed amadeo guillermo broncano who was in the nearby house of a relative rushed to his fathers aid canuel turned to him and attacked him with a bolo although he missed the two then grappled with each other guillermo was able to wrest the bolo from canuel and with it he struck canuel twenty times on the face and in various parts of the body and then stabbed him to finish him off guillermo raged against his fathers assailant because he thought that his father had been killed finding that his father was still alive he took him to the hospital for their part accusedappellants hernani diosdado and dioscoro broncano and antonio varela claimed they were somewhere else at the time of the incident and denied participation in the crime guillermo claimed that when he saw his father sprawled on the ground he thought that he was already dead because of which he was so angry that he gave canuel several bolo blows in different parts of the body without realizing that he had hacked him 16 times the postmortem reports show that canuel died due to hypovolemic shock secondary to multiple hacked wounds and cerebral edema secondary to head injury caused by the following wounds external lesions 1 hacked wound yshaped 10 cm long midfrontal area extending to the medical aspect to the  r  eye 2 hacked wound 50 cm medial aspect of eyebrow  l  3 open skull fracture frontal area 4 hacked wound with tendon & metacarpal bones involvement hand  r  5 hacked wound 60 cm  r  posterolateral

small bowel mesentery 3 lacerated subclavion vein 4 open frontal sinuses with epidermal hematomadr ray tanchuling who made the postmortem report testified that although only one type of sharp instrument a   guinonting   bolo was used to inflict the 16 external wounds it was probable that more than one such instrument wielded by more than one person was actually used in inflicting the wounds moreover lesion no 10 in the postmortem report which is a stab wound caused by a bolo with rugged edges could not have been inflicted by the same bolo used in inflicting the other wounds as dr tanchuling testifiedatty bongon  to witness  q doctor if a certain bolo is having rugged edges could that cause injury no 10 a yes sir it could be possible atty bongon that will be all atty maalat  to witness  q doctor tanchuling you indicated in your new finding that there were internal and external lesions and this could have been caused by sharp instrument a yes sir q based on your medical knowledge could you determine whether the weapon used could be one and the same instrument a that could be possible court  to witness  q but it could be possible that several instrument were used a possible the limit is two because of lesion no 10 court a no further question redirect atty berces  to witness  q you mentioned that the number of the instrument used maybe limited to two considering your finding with rugged edges and hacked wound would it be possible also that it could be instrument of the same kind a possible yes sir if they are the same they have the same sharpness the same finish q and could have several instruments used a there is a possibility the postmortem report corroborates the claim of the prosecution witnesses eduardo and efren bello that the first blow was delivered by amadeo to the forehead of canuel which rendered canuel helpless and that thereafter canuel was hit in several parts of his body the last wound inflicted was according to them a stab wound in the throat of the victim which was inflicted by guillermo the postmortem report shows an actual blow to the forehead which must have been inflicted with such force that it caused an open skull fracture  lesion nos 1 2 and 3  a stab wound above the sternum  lession no 10  confirms the stabbing of the victim in the throat lesion no 9 confirms that there was evisceration of the intestines of the victim while lesion nos 4 5 6 and 7 proves that there were indeed several deep wounds on the arms of canuel on the other hand hernani claimed he was in san lorenzo ruiz camarines norte from march 29 1990 to april 8 1990 having been sent there by his father amadeo to help make copra but a witness cpl rodolfo ofalsa of the philippine army testified that he saw hernani at quinabarasahan in the evening of april 4 1990 and again near the cockpit in the afternoon of april 5 1990cpl ofalsa had been assigned to the place of celebration to help maintain peace and order guillermo claimed that he struck canuel with his bolo again and again   because of my feeling that my father was already dead  it may be that after the first few blows one who acts in selfdefense might deal a few more blows without changing the character of his defense if this was done out of confusion or fear but after delivering several blows to inflict a stab wound in the victims throat as a coup de grace would be to negate any semblance of good faith and manifest a deliberate and wanton intention to kill  
parricide, on november 6 1993 between the hours of 730 and 830 in the evening the appellant domingo castillo jr nicknamed   boyet   was in the d & g restaurant in norzagaray bulacan drinking beer with the victim his father domingo castillo srafter some two hours of drinking a group of noisy customers arrived wary of the trouble that these customers may cause and aware of his sons propensity to get into fights the victim urged the former to go home with himthe appellant and the victim then boarded a blue pickup truck with plate number cbe 5913 the appellant drove the vehicle in the direction of their home in angat bulacan with the victim in the passengers seat during the trip home an argument ensued between the appellant and the victim who were both a bit drunk already because the former kept insisting that he should or could go back to the restaurant while the latter prevented him from doing so upon nearing their house the appellant abruptly stopped the pickup and the victim alighted therefromholding a bottle of beer in his right hand the victim raised both of his hands stood in front of the pickup and said   sige kung gusto mo sagasaan mo ako hindi ka makakaalis    go ahead run over me if you want to leave the appellant slowly drove the pickup forward threatening to run over the victim at this juncture the victim exclaimed   papatayin mo ba ako    are you going to kill me after the victim uttered these words the appellant backedup almost hitting an owner type jeep parked at the side of the road and on board which were four  4  people conversing with each other including prosecution eyewitness ma cecilia mariano then at high speed the appellant drove the pickup forward hitting the victim in the process not satisfied with what he had done the appellant put the vehicle in reverse thereby running over the victim a second time the appellant then alighted from the vehicle and walked towards their houseat the precise moment of the perpetration of the crime another witness arthur agaran who worked at the recapping shop of the victim was in the latters residence he was changing his clothes and preparing to work overtime in the recapping shop located in the premises of the victims residence agaran saw the pickup truck being driven by the appellant and noticed that it moved forward and backward four  4  times about twenty  20  to thirty  30  meters from the house when he and another worker went outside to find out what had happened they saw the victims body bloodied and sprawled on the ground they rushed the victim to the dolorosa hospital at norzagaray bulacan where the victim expired shortly thereafter the appellant was not immediately prosecuted for the death of his father which he was able to pass off as an accident but when his older sister leslie c padilla arrived from the united states to attend her fathers wake and funeral she made inquiries about the circumstances surrounding his death and was given different versions of the incident some of which insinuated that her father did not meet his demise accidentally later a suspicion of foul play moved her to engage the services of the national bureau of investigation  nbi  for a formal investigation into the matter on direct examination mariano testified as follows q while you were there infront  sic  of your house do you recall of any unusual incident that happened a yes sir there was q tell us about that unusual incident a while we were conversing at that time all of a sudden there was a colored blue pick up  sic  that was rushing towards our place in very fast speed  humaharurot  q with whom were you conversing at that time a my two  2  friends and one of my sister  sic  sir q what is the name of your sister a ma lucila g mariano sir q from where did that pick up van come from  sic  a it came from behind our back sir x x x x x x x x x q what happened after you saw that pick up  sic  colored blue speeding in that street a all of a sudden it stopped sir q in your sketch will you please draw a square or a rectangular figure to indicate the position of that van when it stopped at this juncture the witness is indicating the same q after that pick up  sic  stopped what happened next a it stopped there sir q how about you what did you do when the pick up stopped a we were looking at it we did not mind it q after that did you notice anything unusual that happened around the premises a yes sir q tell us about that unusual incident a an old man alighted sir q from where did that old man alight a from the pick up  sic  sir court q the blue pick up  sic  a yes your honor fiscal q from what side of the pick up  sic  did he alight from the left or from the right side a from the right side sir q after that old man had alighted what happened a i noticed that the pick up  sic  colored blue thru the headlight seems to be moving trying to intimidate the old man then i heard the old man saying   papatayin mo ba ako   and at that time he was holding a bottle of beer sir q in this sketch will you please draw the position of that old man at this juncture the witness is doing the same q after the old man uttered those words what happened a i just saw that the pick up made a back up  sic  almost hitting us sir q then what did the driver of that pick up  sic  do afterwards after backing up rather a all of a sudden the pick up  sic  ran very fast and hit the old man sir q you said that that vehicle backed up and then it proceeded very fast hitting the old man in the process is that correct a yes sir q did the old man change his position after he uttered   papatayin mo ba ako   up to the time that he was hit by that pick up van a yes sir q will you please indicate where the old man proceed  sic  at this juncture the witness is doing the same q when you saw the old man hit by that pick up  sic  did you do anything a i was just shocked sir q and what happened to the pick up  sic  after it hit the old man a after it hit the old man i noticed that it moved backwards again and then the headlight was on at that time and i saw the old man lying sprawled on the road sir q and what did you do after you saw the old man lying sprawled on the street a i just say  sic  to my companion   hoy nasagasaan yong matanda   then all of us were shocked and we noticed that the driver of that pick up  sic  was  sic  alighted sir q were you able to recognize the driver of that pick up who alighted from that vehicle a i did not recognize i just recall that he was wearing white shorts sir x x x x x x x x x q after that driver wearing white shorts alighted from that pick up  sic  where did he proceed a he walked towards the town proper walking sir q when you said that he walk  sic  are you saying that the driver left his vehicle in the middle of the street a yes sir he left the pick up  sic   emphasis supplied  the records are bereft of any evidence that the appellant had tried to avoid hitting the victim who positioned himself in front of the pickup on the contrary marianos testimony is to the effect that prior to actually hitting the victim the appellant was   intimidating   him by moving the pickup forward thus prompting the victim to exclaim   papatayin mo ba ako   worse the appellant backedup to gain momentum then accelerated at a very fast speed knowing fully well that the vehicle would definitely hit the victim who was still standing in front of the same the appellants actuations subsequent thereto also serve to refute his allegation that he did not intend to kill his father surely the appellant must have felt the impact upon hitting the victim the normal reaction of any person who had accidentally ran over another would be to immediately alight from the vehicle and render aid to the victim but as if to ensure the victims death the appellant instead backedup thereby running over the victim again this explains why as testified to by agaran he saw the imprint of tiremarks on the victims feet even more indicative that this was a coldblooded killing and not an accident as appellant would have us believe is his deliberate failure to promptly summon help for his father mariano categorically testified that after the appellant had ran over the victim he alighted from the pickup and walked in the direction of the town the appellants claim that he shouted for help and called the workers in the recapping shop to bring his father to the hospital is obviously a fabrication agaran recounted that after the incident the appellant walked towards their house and while passing in front of the recapping shop merely looked at him and the other workers thereat a man who had not intended to harm his own father would not walk but more likely run in search of help aware of the fact that his fathers life is precariously hanging in the balance the normal reaction of a child is to waste no time in trying to save his life the appellant on the other hand did not even lift a finger to help his own father whose life he had so brutally taken away it was agaran and the other workers who on their own accord brought the victim to the hospital in the light of the foregoing circumstances we therefore find it difficult to believe that the appellant did not act with malice worth reiterating here is the rule that evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself — such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances ironically it is the appellants testimony that finally clinches his conviction his testimony reveals that a certain degree of enmity and resentment characterized his relationship with his parents the appellant was the only son of well to do parents he had never held a days job in his entire life and although already a family man himself he continued to rely solely on his parents support that he was a   little spoiled   is beyond doubt the appellant admitted that during the previous years he and his parents had some differences as a matter of fact several days prior to the incident his father who wanted him to look for a job had a   heart to heart talk   with him and asked him   ganito ka na lang ba    will you never change  finally it was the appellant himself who told the court that the incident was preceded by an argument between him and his father who was determined to prevent him from returning to the restaurant 35 but what exactly motivated the appellant to commit so heinous a crime continues to be beyond the comprehension of this court there is however no need to delve into the same as the facts proven during trial speak eloquently of the commission of a crime and the identity of the author thereof  
parricide,   that on or about the 11th day of may 1994 in the city of dagupan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the above named accused rodolfo opera  jr with intent to

kitchen of their house rufina maminta an anguished mother and out of love for her daughter begged the appellant again and again that her dying daughter be brought to the hospital but seemingly without any concern appellant staunchly refused to rush alicia to the nearest hospital; reasoning that she could not reach the hospital alive an external examination of the body of the deceased was conducted on may 14 1994 by dr tomas cornel upon the request of mrs maminta on may 18 1994 an exhumation followed by an autopsy of the remains of the deceased was conducted by dr ronald bandonill of the nbi again upon the request of the herein complainant according to dr bandonills report the presence of multiple injuries all over the body and the suspicious presence of multiple abrasions on the area of the neck not related to the hanging gives the suicidal aspect a big question markwith respect to the said   suspicious   multiple abrasions on the neck the same were clarified by the same doctor as   brasionsmultiple with signs of strangulation encircling the neck at an area of 320 cms x 45 cms just below the thyroid cartilage  aside from the said abrasions there were twelve  12  abrasions and one

yard wooden truss from the floor of the kitchen and found it to be six  6  feet the deceased was 56   in height on the basis of the foregoing facts and circumstances rufina maminta instituted the case of parricide at bar against the appellant the   suicide by hanging   theory of the defense appellant asseverates that at about 6 oclock in the morning of may 11 1994 his wife alicia opera  was discovered hanging from a kitchen truss by their daughter jonaliz who then woke him up and informed him of what happenedthereafter appellant told his brother gary to inform alicias mother the

alive according to her alicia was still breathing and tears were flowing from her eyes she then went to her barangay and returned on a tricycle driven by joselito paragas like the complainant the latter also claimed that he saw tears in alicias eyes and her adams apple was moving complainant then suggested that alicia be brought to the hospital however the appellant said that   theres no more hope as shes already dead   appellant theorized that the deceased committed suicide by hanging and placed heavy reliance on medical evidence according to him both autopsy reports reveal a ligature mark above the thyroid cartilage consistent with hanging as regards the multiple abrasions on the body of the deceased appellant tried to explain their probable cause thus1  due to improper handling when embalmed; 2  while being dressed; 3  use of stone when bathing; or 4  selfinfliction such as scratching ruling of the lower court as recited by the trial court   evidence for the prosecution consisted of the testimonies of the following spo1 daniel coronel nbi dr ronald bandonill dr tomas cornel joselito paragas and rufina maminta spo1 daniel coronel pnp member of dagupan city police

dagupan city he found out that alicia opera  was already lying flat on the floor of the kitchen alicia was wearing a duster barefooted no traces of blood but there were markings appearing on her neck

deceased also found was an alleged suicide note  exh 2  dr ronald bandonill a physician and presently nbi medicolegal officer testified that he received a request from the municipal mayor of binmaley pangasinan atty jose fabia for the exhumation of the cadaver of alicia opera  on may 18 1994 at around 1000 oclock in the morning he conducted the exhumation in the presence of the deceaseds mother

helpers of the memorial park in connection with the exhumation he made an exhumation report consisting of two pages  exhs g & g1  he also stated in his findings that the cause of death is asphyxia by hanging and remarked that the presence of multiple injuries all over the body and the suspicious presence of multiple abrasions on the neck area not related to the hanging gives the suicidal aspect a big question mark dr tomas cornel physician and asst city health officer of dagupan city testified that on may 14 1994 a member of the pnp dagupan city requested him to perform a postmortem examination on the body of deceased alicia opera  he conducted the postmortem examination at the deceaseds house at carael dist dagupan city three  3  days after her death he ordered that the cadaver be removed from the coffin and placed on a flat wooden bed the deceaseds clothes were removed when he conducted the examination the mother of the deceased rufina maminta and two members of the pnp dagupan city were present; while the husband accused rodolfo opera  jr was not around the result of the examination was all reflected in his report  exh i  with the following findings external findings 1 ligature mark around the neck from the mastoid left and right and anterior portion of the neck above the thyroid cartilage 2 abrasion parietal and frontal area left 3 abrasion shoulder posterior aspect left 4 abrasion midscapular line level of the 3rd thoracic vertebra left 5 abrasion lumbar region along the vertebral column 6 contusion hematoma medial aspect middle 3rd thigh left 7 abrasion anterior trunk left 8 abrasion popleteal area left 9 abrasion buttock medial aspect right 10 abrasion posterior aspect distal 3rd leg left 11 abrasion lateral aspect distal 3rd leg left 12 abrasion postero lateral aspect middle 3rd leg right 13 abrasion postero medial aspect proximal 3rd thigh right in his finding no 1 the injury might have been caused by hanging or by excessive force of strangulation the abrasions are superficial injuries caused by rough instrument and it depends upon the one who inflicted the injury because the abrasions are sic  only slight or it is also possible that they are  sic  deliberately inflicted contusions & hematoma are  sic  most probably caused by the impact with a blunt instrument or by fist blows or by striking with a piece of wood all the injuries in his findings might have been inflicted most probably before the death of alicia opera  the death might have been caused by asphyxia or the obstruction of air passage due to hanging because of the ligature mark from the mastoid left portion just after the left cartilage as he conducted the postmortem 3 days after the body was embalmed he could not determine anymore whether the tongue was protruding or not the kind of injuries sustained by the deceased were  sic  not possibly selfinflicted especially so that she is a woman and the injuries were located on the different parts of the body scattered especially on the back part of the medial aspect which might be possibly caused by pulling the victim within  sic  upward or downward it is highly improbable that these 13 wounds were inflicted by the deceased if she hanged herself when he conducted the postmortem examination photographs were taken and he identified those photographs joselito paragas testified that he had known rufina maminta for a long time already on may 11 1994 at around 620 oclock in the morning he was asked by rufina maminta to go with her to carael district dagupan city to help her bring her

at around 630 in the morning of the same day she came back together with joselito paragas; and scolded him and telling  sic  him many things she wanted to bring her daughter to the hospital for treatment but he told his motherinlaw that alicia is already dead as she is no longer breathing and was already cold he informed the local civil registrar of dagupan city about his wifes death and it was one of the clerks therein who placed cardiorespiratory arrest as one of the causes of death because he informed the clerk that his wife committed suicide the incident was also reported to the police by max opera  his brother on crossexamination accused testified that he did not see any tear rolling on the cheek of his wife but he noticed the watery portion on the flooring just below her body and that her underwear was wet he also noticed some bubbles in her mouth and her tongue slightly protruded he also noticed that his wifes feet hanging was about 2 1/2 inches from the flooring and her head was touching the truss of their kitchen he further testified that his motherinlaw disliked him as soninlaw from the very beginning and now she accused him of killing his wife during their marriage there was no problem between them but there was one time that his wife complained of her ligation because she cant  sic  eat sleep and she was thinking very deeply one day she asked his permission to have a vacation at canaoalan he gave permission to take a vacation she even took a vacation in manila and c o me back to carael only on may 1 1994 he was not happy about his wifes stay in manila but he did not make any quarrel with her on the third week of her stay in manila she called him over the phone but they had no heated argument the day following her arrival from manila they made love with each other as husband and wife and she was happy about it after that she was again back to thinking deeply he told her to go out of the house and enjoy life mingle with their neighbors but she did not do it on may 5 1994 he brought her to a quack doctor who told them that somebody was watching her and advised him to have the guava tree in front of their house cut and so he cut the guava tree he also asked her  sic  wife to see a doctor of medicine but she refused since his wife arrived from manila on may 1 1994 up to the night of may 10 1994 they have  sic  no misunderstanding and they never quarreled although there was one time when somebody complained to the police that he kissed a young woman his wife did not get angry with him instead she helped him settle the case on the night of may 10 1994 he also saw eleven  11  capsules of ativan drug his wife told him what is her purpose in taking that kind of medicine but he told her not to take all the capsules at one time

not tell the police about the drug he told them only about the bubbles he saw on his wifes mouth he was not able to mention about the ativan capsule s  and the bubbles in her mouth when dr coronel  sic  arrived in their house because he was not around that time rufina maminta testified on rebuttal that it is not true that she dislikes her soninlaw after their wedding rodolfo and alicia lived in their house until she became pregnant with their first child during those times she never had any misunderstanding with her sonin l aw sometimes  sic  in march 1994 her daughter came to her and told her about their quarrel but she told her to return to their house because that is their life as husband and wife she was able to persuade her daughter to return to their house sometime in april 1994 alicia asked permission from the accused to let her go to manila to attend a wedding party she also asked her soninlaw to let alicia go with them but she received no reaction from him during their stay in manila her daughter had a talk with her husband over the telephone and she saw alicia crying although she can not hear their conversation she asked alicia why she was crying and alicia told her that her husband will kill her if she returns to dagupan city she told her daughter that its just normal between husband and wife when they returned from manila one of her daughters marjorie accompanied alicia to their house on may 8 1994 alicia came to her again telling her about their quarrel because her husband kissed a woman at the interbank where accused was a security guard to settle the case she and alicia accompanied by the brgy captain of carael talked to the girl kissed by the accused they paid the girl p1000000 in settling the case it is not likewise true that it was on her second return to the accuseds house that she asked the accused to let her bring her daughter to a hospital because after she was fetched by gary opera  she asked her soninlaw to bring her daughter to a hospital but accused refused she testified further that there was no instance during the lifetime of alicia that the latter told her that she was going to put an end to her life from the evidence the court finds that on may 11 1994 at about 600 oclock in the morning mrs rufina maminta mother of alicia opera   victim  was called by gary opera  brother of the accused to go with him to carael dagupan city saying that something happened to your daughter and that he will tell it at home when she arrived in  sic  the house of rodolfo and alicia opera  she found her daughter  alicia  lying on the cemented floor when asked what happened the accused said i did nothing to your daughter she told him why worry when you have not done anything to my daughter she embraced her daughter and asked her what happened to you my daughter  t ears rolled from her eyes but was speechless she wanted to take alicia to the hospital but the accused refused saying anyway she will not reach the hospital anymore she returned to canaoalan binmaley and asked joselito paragas to help her take alicia to the hospital but again the accused refused saying no more mother because she will not survive anyway then max opera  brother of the accused told them not to touch the body because this is still the jurisdiction of dagupan city and you should not interfere again the accused intervened saying she is my wife and dont lift her up rufina maminta asked the nbi to conduct an autopsy on the cadaver of alicia she reported the fact of death to the police station and the report was entered in the police blotter  exhibit f  and requested that the case be investigated spo1 coronel conducted an on the spot investigation and caused the taking of pictures of the deceased and the place where she was lying she also requested dr tomas coronel  sic  of the city health office in dagupan city to conduct a postmortem examination of the deceased  exhibit i  joselito paragas corroborated the testimony of rufina maminta that she asked him to help her bring alicia to a hospital he noticed contusion  asireg  below her adams apple he likewise testified that he saw tears flowing from alicias eyes and he observed the palpitation below her adams apple the claim of the accused that when rufina maminta arrived her daughter alicia was already dead is negated by the remarks of the accused when he said no more mother because she will not survive anyway and nanay do not bring her anymore to the hospital because she will die just the same the suicide theory of the defense is negated by the remarks of dr ronald bandonill medicolegal officer iii of the nbi baguio city who conducted the exhumation of the cadaver of alicia opera  and his autopsy at the eternal garden memorial park in dagupan city on may 18 1994  exhibit g1c  which reads the presence of multiple injuries all over the body of  sic  the suspicious presence of multiple abrasions on the neck area not related to hanging gives the suicidal aspect a big question mark it is hard to believe that the victim maltreated herself before consummating her desire dr bandonill jr further found abrasions multiple with signs of strangulations encircling the neck at an area of 320 cms x 45 cms just below the thyroid cartilage this finding strangely indicate that the victim was strangulated; thus negated the contention of the defense that the victim committed suicide by hanging herself dr tomas cornel assistant city health officer of dagupan city testified that the cause of death may be excessive force of strangulation/ sic  dr cornel further declared that he did not find any ligature of a knot which would show that the victim hanged herself with the use of the electric cord  exhibit c  it is highly improbable for the victim to sustain all the thirteen  13  wounds all over the body if she hanged herself the accused declared that the victim who is 56   in height hanged herself in  sic  a roof wooden truss at the kitchen which is six  6  feet from the floor it is very hard to believe how she could hang herself in such a situation according to spo1 daniel coronel  sic  the wooden truss measured 2   x 3   by one yard if indeed the victim hanged herself from the wooden truss said wooden truss would have been broken considering the size and weight of the victim as shown in  exhibits a a1 a2 and a3  likewise the accused contradicted himself when he reported the fact of death of his wife to the local civil registrar of dagupan city the death certificate  exhibit l  shows that the accused is the reportee; and that the causes of death are cardio respiratory arrest drug overdose  poisoning  mental depression    exhibit l1  if it were true that his wife committed suicide and hanged herself why did he omit the same when he reported the fact of death of his wife it is significant to note that the defense failed to present proof of drug overdose and mental depression it is possible that cardiorespiratory arrest as the cause of death could have been produced by strangulation or choking the motive of the killing could be the frequent quarrels between the accused and his wife aggravated by the laying of hands on his wife this is clear in his counteraffidavit to the complaint that the usual cause of quarrels was the inability of the accused to provide some needs of the wife and so the accused got angry at her and at times laid hands on her in april 1994 the accused and his wife quarreled when the latter went to manila with her mother to attend a wedding when she failed to return home immediately they talked over the telephone by long distance and the accused told his wife that he will kill her if she returns to dagupan city on may 8 1994 the victim reported to her mother that she and her husband quarreled when she learned that her husband kissed a girl inside the interbank in dagupan city where he is working as a security guard this incident was settled through the intercession of complainant rufina maminta and her daughter alicia where the complainant paid the girl the sum of ₱1000000

september 16 1993 he went to sleep he was awakened by his mother at about 10 oclock telling him that there was an ongoing quarrel downstairs among appellant gaspar and romeo felix and rogelio so appellant ernesto took his mother out of the house and went to the safety of the house of his uncle gaudioso sinda he stayed there until the following morning while there is no evidence of a previous

does not disclose any ulterior motive on his part to perjure himself against appellant the appellant was the only person directly in front of them confronting the deceased with a drawn gun this positive identification of appellant as the murderer renders unnecessary any proof of motive on his partappellants belief that policeman lope jimena who was with the victim and sebua at the time of the assault would have been a better witness as to identity of the assailant is pure speculation the fact that he might have been a better witness does not necessarily negate sebuas ability to the face and heard the voice of the accused moments before he fired the first four shots at the victim the candor of sebua in admitting that his affidavit does not contain the number of shot fired by the accused and instead states that the accused shot the deceased without asking any question accentuates his truthfulness he explained that he did not notice the discrepancy when he signed it that the prosecution did not present patrolman jimena as a witness to be considered a reversible error; because aside from the fact that jimena was merely a corroborative witness and therefore not necessary for the prosecution to establish its case he was equally available to the defense if the defense was minded to do so the record shows that the prosecution reserved patrolman jimena for rebuttal but which reservation became useless because the accused submitted the case for decision and expressly waived his right to present evidence in his defense however as correctly mandated by the defense and the solicitor general the crime of direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority has not been established by evidence beyond reasonable doubt the record is bereft of any proof even remotely suggesting that the accused herein knew that the victim was then performing his official functions as police sergeant the victim was not in uniform at the time as shown by pictures  exhs e e1 e2 e7 and e11  the deceased was then wearing dark pants and a polo shirt tucked inside his waistline while the deceased then had his service firearm buttoned inside its holster hanging by his right waist and was then with two of his policemen these facts alone do not indicate that he was then in the performance of his police duties and there is no showing that the accused appellant personally knew of the entry in the police blotter that deceased was then on twentyfourhour duty as field sergeant  exhs d d1 and d2 p 62 of exh d  much less is there proof that the assault on the victim was provoked or by reason of an act performed by the victim in his official capacity likewise there is no evidence of the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation the time interval between the act if any on the part of the deceased that might have provoked the accused appellant or the time when the deceased might have intimated his anger at appellant and that actual killing is not shown consequently we cannot determine whether the accused appellant had sufficient time within which to reflect on the evil character of the crime before he committed the same but the qualifying circumstance of treachery had been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt while mere suddenness of a frontal attack may not necessarily be indicative of treachery; the circumstances surrounding the frontal attack made by the appellant on his victim indubitably demonstrate treachery on his part despite the fact that both the victim and patrolman lope jimena were armed policeman sebua was with them and the scene was welllighted by a 50watt bulb just about four meters above them   1  the appearance of the accused before the three was so sudden that the three did not even notice the direction from where he came and patrolman sebua was so surprised that he just gaped at the accused gripped by the fear that he might be hit after the accused fired his already drawn gun at the victim  2  the accused appeared with a drawn gun pointed directly at the deceased ready to fire at will the moment anyone of the three more particularly the victim would make any move  3  the accused fired four successive shots at the victim at a distance of about three feet soon after he asked the victim whether be was still angry with him before the victim could retort and before anyone of the three could stir in their seats  4  to further insure that the victim could not possibly adopt any measure of selfdefense the accused appellant pumped four successive shots into the cardiac and pleural cavities of the victim followed by three more shots as policeman sebua and jimena scampered for their own safety the victim was not even able to reach for his gun much less unbutton the flap which secured it inside its holster that seven shots were fired by the accused at the victim as evidenced by the seven empty shells and five slugs of a 38 caliber firearm found near the body of the victim shows that one bullet was already inside the chamber of the gun while six bullets were in its magazine one of the five slugs was found embedded in the asphalt beneath the cadaver of the victim the two other slugs could not be located the victim sustained thirteen wounds including one above the left nipple another below the left nipple one on the right hypochondriac region one on the left abdomen above the umbilicus and one on the right abdomen above the umbilicus from the sketch made by dr modesto santos the victim sustained six entrance wounds on the frontal part of the body marked as nos 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 in exh c1 four exit wounds marked nos 10 11 12 and 13 exh c2 and a gunshot wound on the forearm of the thirteen wounds according to the doctor three were fatal two of which were above and below the left nipple  see exhs c and c1 tqw as suddenly as he appeared in front of the victim the appellant disappeared in a flash into the darkness beyond the circle of light coming from the lighted watt bulb after emptying his firearm into the victims body thus eluding apprehension even as the chief of police and a companion pursued him towards the neighboring town of mogpog

homicide, the evidence for the prosecution shows that at around 930 in the evening of june 7 1995 richard grajo the son of the victim igmidio grajo was with a group of friends in front of the store of edgardo cruz on rodriguez street tanay rizal when he saw his father coming richard hid inside the store thinking he would be sent home from where he was hiding richard saw accusedappellants henry and nilo bautista walking behind his father apparently sensing the presence of accusedappellants igmidio ran inside the house of cruz which adjoins the store but as accusedappellants were pursuing him igmidio ran outside the house accusedappellants caught up with igmidio in front of the house of cruz henry tried to stab him with a knife    balisong    but igmidio was able to evade the thrust at this point richard came out of the store to help his father however noli held him and pushed him to the ground three prosecution witnesses joseph manansala armando alalid and jerry fontanos testified that noli punched richard in the stomach while henry stabbed igmidio several times with the   balisong   causing the latter to fall to the ground on his back accusedappellants then ran away igmidio was taken to a hospital where he died on the other hand the defense presented evidence showing the following henry bautista met igmidio grajo on his way home on rodriguez street tanay rizal in the evening of june 7 1995 igmidio appeared to be drunk and began cursing henry without any provocation to avoid trouble henry turned back but igmidio hit him from behind with a lead pipe as henry staggered igmidio continued to hit him on the head and arms causing him to retreat further back in selfdefense henry gave igmidio a kick which threw the latter against a tricycle parked nearby but igmidio got a knife from the tricycle seeing this henry grappled with igmidio for possession of the weapon henry succeeded in wresting the knife from igmidio and with it stabbed the latter in the chest at this point noli arrived at the scene and pacified henry who allowed himself to be brought to his house however as he was apprehensive that relatives of igmidio might seek revenge henry went to the house of noli and then to that of a friend but as both were not home henry hid in the cemetery and from there took a ride to his hometown sta cruz laguna on june 9 1995 henry was told by relatives that noli had been taken into custody for the killing of igmidio he was prevailed upon to surrender to the mayor of tanay rizal who that same day sent his driver to sta cruz laguna to fetch

manansala jessie bola jess buenaventura eric jasmin june austria tots dizon and joel nacor sir q do i understand from you that this is a big store a not so big sir q while you and your companions were talking do you recall if there was an unusual incident that happened at that time a yes sir q what is that unusual incident a i witnessed how they killed my father sir q tell us the incident of how your father was killed a my father went to me at the store sir q after that what happened next a and following him were brothers henry and nilo sir q tell us the surname of these two brothers a bautista sir q when you noticed that danilo bautista and henry bautista were following your father what took place next a henry bautista stabbed my father and i was pushed by nilo bautista so that i cant extend help to my father sir q how many times did henry bautista stab your father a at the first stab my father was able to evade and ran but he followed my father and he was able to approach him outside of the house sir q what happened after that a they ran in and out of the house sir q what happened after they ran in and out of the house with henry bautista pursuing your father a when henry overtook my father he stabbed him for several times and when he saw blood he ran together with nilo bautista sir q while henry bautista was stabbing your father where were you at that time a i was there at the place of the incident sir q how far were you from your father while he was being stabbed by henry bautista a about five meters sir q while you were five meters from your father and who at

shouting to henry to stop stabbing my father sir q considering that this incident happened at around 930 in the evening how were you able to see this incident a there was light at the place and also

general hospital sir q what happened at the hospital a he was dead upon arrival sir the testimony of richard was substantially corroborated by joseph manansala armando alalid and jerry fontanos joseph manansala was one of richards companions on the night in question armando alalid is a member of the junior police group of tanay rizal which is assigned to direct traffic in that municipality he was passing by the area with jerry fontanos when accusedappellants allegedly attacked igmidio it is settled that because of its opportunity to observe the facial expressions gestures and tones of voice of a witness while testifying the trial courts evaluation of the testimony of witnesses is entitled to great respect in the instant case accusedappellants have not shown that the trial court erred in giving weight to the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution moreover although proof as to the motive of the accused is not essential when there is direct testimony regarding the commission of the offense motive may nevertheless aid in establishing his guilt in this case the evidence shows that henry and igmidio had a dispute regarding their adjacent properties two weeks prior to the commission of the offense richard thus testified fiscal q do you know of any reason why henry and nilo bautista will kill your father a what i know was that one day there was an incident that my father saw   balat ng aso   [dumped into] in our lot which came from the adjacent lot owned by henry and nilo bautista and my father confronted them and asked why are throwing dirt on said vacant lot of which my father is the caretaker and then henry bautista showed a knife and said   anong gusto mong mangyari   and my father answered   hindi naman ganyan bakit tayo aabot sa ganyan   q when did that incident happen a two weeks before the incident sir q will you please look inside the courtroom and tell us if this nilo and henry bautista are present a yes sir in contrast the testimony of the witnesses for the defense is marked by contradictions as the following portion of henrys testimony shows fiscal q now during your testimony last june 26 1996 you were asked by your counsel the following question at least try to recall which one was first hit by the said person which part of your body a my right arm q you said   kanang kamay   a yes sir q a while ago you testified that the first part of your body that was hit is your head which of the two statement are correct a the correct one is that part of my head  witness indicating by his left hand the left back portion of his head was the first one hit  q and so why did you tell your lawyer during the previous hearing that it is your right arm that was hit first a because when i testified first on june 26 1996 i was   nataranta   q now also on the same date the question was propounded then which part was the next one hit by igmidio grajo and you answered my left arm do you remember having made that statement a yes sir i was asked that question q a while ago you stated that the second part of your body that was hit was your right arm near the wrist portion a yes sir q which of the two is the correct one a the right wrist portion of my arm q and why did you say that in your answer to atty dela cuesta is that it is your first arm that was hit by igmidio grajo a i was also dizzy at the time i answered atty dela cuesta q during the same testimony you were again asked a question and then after that what other part of your body was hit and you answered my back do you recall having made that statement a yes sir q now during your testimony a while ago you mentioned that the third part of your body that was hit was your right arm is that also correct a yes sir q which of that statement is correct a the right arm q in other words all the question asked of you by your lawyer and answered by you were not correctly answered by you and it is only now that you are answering correctly a yes sir the defense presented a medical certificate dated june 9 1995 and signed by dr daniel m alagon to the effect that he treated henry for contusions on the chest left shoulder and right forearm but dr alagon could not remember examining henry or issuing the medical certificate nor could he find any record in the files of his clinic that he treated henry moreover dr alagon stated that he could not deduce with any certainty from the medical certificate that the alleged injuries of henry had been sustained on the night of june 7 1995 when igmidio was killed hence the medical certificate is insufficient to establish the allegation of the defense that henry was attacked by igmidio as pointed out by the solicitor general the prosecution has established that igmidio sustained four stab wounds and one incised wound which bely henrys claim of selfdefensein any event even if henrys testimony were true he cannot be exonerated for the killing of igmidio on the ground of selfdefense he testified on crossexamination q now you mentioned that you retaliated by kicking igmidio grajo is that right a yes sir q and as a result of your kicking igmidio grajo was thrown back to the tricycle a yes sir q and in fact during your testimony during the last hearing you testified that   lumipad si igmidio grajo sa tricycle   a yes sir q in other words the kick which you delivered to igmidio grajo was so strong that its effect was he flew to the tricycle a yes sir q and as a result his back hit the tricycle is that right a yes sir q and that you also heard that when his back hit the tricycle there is a noise that was created as a result of impact a yes sir q and so youll admit that igmidio grajo was badly hurt by that impact a yes sir q and after that you went to igmidio grajo to further inflict injuries on him is that right a yes sir q and you intend to do that because of those many blows which he delivered on your head arms and chest a yes sir q and then you rained blows on the different parts of the body of igmidio grajo a yes sir q and as a result of that igmidio grajo was rendered helpless and defenseless a yes sir  
murder, the victim was rosalito cere a twentyyearold medical canvasser for a pharmaceutical company he had no known quarrel with any of the accused apparently his father was the real object of hostility for prior to the tragic occurrence said father benito cere a barangay councilman had twice been attacked and mauled by herein accusedappellants and criminal charges had been filed against the latterthe evident animosity between the accusedappellants and the elder cere made felisa cere the victims mother nervous she normally arranged for her son rosalito to be met in his way home on july 10 1987 as mrs cere was told that her son would be coming home she asked her daughter gerarda villagonzalo to meet rosalito on his way home from the provincial road where the bus would stop at around five oclock in the afternoon while waiting for rosalito at a nearby farm gerarda villagonzalo heard gunshots she hid behind a coconut tree but saw clearly what was happening her brother rosalito was staggering and trying to flee from a group of men all with firearms rosalito had fallen to his knees and with arms raised up pleaded for mercy the men numbering seven in all surrounded rosalito and did not heed his entreaty edgar layaguin shot him on the left arm rizalino gemina followed and shot rosalito twice a third man greg labayo again shot rosalito twice the others merely stood around with guns aimed at their lone preygerarda villagonzalo ran back home shocked and unable to speak only after she was made to drink a glass of water was she able to recount the gruesome incident that her brother suffered in the hands of accusedappellants at or about midnight gerarda villagonzalo along with her uncles and other relatives returned to the crime scene to locate her brother rosalito was brought home lifeless dr melecio i cabatingan the rural health officer of alcantara cebu who conducted the postmortem examination reported five gunshot wounds on the left upper eyelid on the left eye on the left arm left lateral side of the bodyon the left palm and on the abdomen the first three being fatal rosalitos death was reportedly due to cardiorespiratory arrest and multiple gunshot woundstheprosecution presented gerarda villagonzalo as its lone eyewitness to give an account of the events that transpired on july 10 1987 all the accused gave the defense of alibi rizalino gemina said he was out fishing the whole day with edgar layaguin and juvy tabotabo the allegedly returned at seven oclock in the evening gorgonio maris was working at the construction of his grandparents house up to six oclock pm florencio dionaldo and rolando bucog were at their respective homes with the former singing playing the guitar and going out only to feed their cow and the latter taking care of his younger brother and sister villagonzalo testified that she could not tell in what direction the assailants fled after killing rosalito because   they were already away when i saw    sic appellants claim that it is unlikely for her not to know where the attackers fled after the killing if she was really present at the scene of the crime while we can only deduce the reason she failed to notice the appellants as they took to their heels we consider this a matter of minor importance which does not detract at al from the credibility of her testimony appellants further add that when villagonzalo testified that her brother was staggering this necessarily means that he had already been shot or wounded this contradicts her earlier statement as confirmed by the doctor that rosalito was shot only five times appellants are in error villagonzalo did not testify that her brother was staggering because he was already woundedshe made no such statement despite persistent crossexamination the fact that the victim was staggering does not necessarily mean that he was wounded he may have been severely beaten or just confused and in a state of panic another inconsistency noted by appellants relates to the number of times that villagonzalo met her brother on his way home felisa cere testified that there have been three previous incidences villagonzalo said it was her first time to fetch her brother again the court finds this matter to be of relatively slight importance which does not affect her trustworthinessit is also improbable appellants maintain that the cere family would let rosalitos dead body lie in the crime scene for seven hours before they returned to retrieve it while not necessarily the best thing that could have been done under the circumstances it does not appears as improbable as the appellants claim considering that rosalitos attackers were all armed the cere family would have been understandably afraid or at least hesitant to charge in to the crime scene without support or companions when they returned to claim rosalitos body they had already asked their relatives to go with themappellants also make much of the fact that villagonzalo is the victims sister they claim that her relationship to the deceased renders her testimony doubtful more than once we have ruled that mere relationship does not necessarily impair the credibility of a witnessparticularly a prosecution witness in fact a relative such as villagonzalo who was the victims older sister would have a natural interest in securing the conviction of the true guilty party and not let the latter get awayfinally appellants contend that the wounds on the victims body were not conclusively proved to be gunshot wounds and that the cause of death was not sufficiently establishedthe court upholds the trial court which found the testimony and findings of dr melecio cabatingan sufficient to prove the number and kind of wounds sustained by the victim as well as the cause of his deathaccording to appellants the aforementioned circumstances reflect an infirm eyewitness testimony and only was shows that the family merely speculated that appellants are the assailants because of the enmity between them and the victims father after a close study of the records and transcripts of stenographic notes we rule that the clarity of villagonzalos testimony proves their guilt beyond reasonable doubt the witness testimony was spontaneous convincing and unshaken as held by the trial courtrizalino gemina edgar layaguin and juvy tabotabo claimed they were fishing at a nearby island the whole day up to five oclock pm came to shore only at seven oclock pmthese young men were fishing the whole day leaving at seven oclock am and coming back twelve hours later yet they were not fishermen by occupation nor did they do this often layaguin and tabotabo testified that they were farmers tabotabo presented federico dalubay as a witness to testify that both tabotabo and layaguin were at the cere residence at ten oclock pm on the night of the killing to condole with the family this is incredible after considering that gerarda villagonzalo testified that they only got to rosalitos body around midnight dalubay admitted that he was asked to testify by tabotabos father and that actually juvy tabotabo is his wifes first cousinthese facts contribute to the doubtful veracity of this witness testimony gorgonio maris testified that he was working he was at his grandparents house on july 10 1987 from eight oclock in the morning up to five oclock in the afternoon and that he went home at six oclock in the evening like the victims family and the rest of the appellants he lives in barangay sta cruz ronda cebu it is also significant to note that the house he was working in is also in the vicinity of the crime scene for it is also situated in ronda cebu to support his alibi maris presented rodolfo caingles a coworker to testify that he was there at the construction site at the time of the crime the bias of this witness became evident after crossexamination when with great reluctance and under repeated questioning he admitted that his wife and the wife of gorgonio maris were sistersflorencio dionaldo who testified that he was a fisherman on crossexamination showed his unfamiliarity with the shoreline nearest his residence and with the faces of the moon his counsel later manifested that fishing was actually dionaldos   hobby   in an attempt to save his clients testimonymoreover dionaldo testified that he was at home singing and playing the guitar or just lounging around again it must be pointed out that dionaldo lives in ronda cebu not very far from the scene of the crime nor from the victims home rolando bucogs alibi that he was at

murder, a mans anguished cries for help at around 300 oclock in the afternoon of october 22 1989 awakened prosecution witness felicidad duhaylungsod who was asleep at her home she instinctively peered out the window and from there at an approximate distance of twenty meters she vividly witnessed a ghastly incident accusedappellants nestor babor and his wife sony babor both armed with bolos were chasing a fleeing a and bloodied evangelino camias then to duhaylungsods horror sony babor lunged with her weapon at the hapless camias and hacked him three times on different parts of the body nestor babor then delivered the fatal blow by stabbing camias on the chest with his weapon the three were all neighbors of felicidad duhaylungsod in rizal palawan and were known to her appellants contended at the trial that the fatal event was the result of the victims attempt to ravish sony babor at their residence in barangay bunog rizal sony and jonalyn testified that on the day and time in question the victim arrived at their house and asked for   tuba   a local type of coconut wine sony who was then attending to her newborn baby replied that their supply thereof had all been consumed she then availed of the occasion to press camias to settle his unpaid dect to them without warning camias crept toward sony and began to assault her sexually appellant managed to extricate herself from the clutches of camias after biting him on the hand and fleeing from him sony babors actuations enraged the victim who then unsheathed his bolo and ran after appellant a hacking blow by camias hit and wounded sony on the upper right hand just as the latter was about to make good her escape at this point nestor babor arrived and saw his wife bleeding from her wound and shouting for help before he could attend to her he was attacked by camias causing him to likewise make a dash for safety with the rampaging camias closely behind him thereafter and this would be appellants version of the second stage of the flight nestor was able to get hold of a bolo from a nearby cart and he then stood his ground after parrying a blow from the victim he retaliated with a stabbing blow of his own which hit the victim on the chest the latter then fell to the ground from that blow which apparently was a fatal one nestor babor asserted to the end that he had delivered just one stabbing thrust on the victim he had simply acted in defense of himself and of his family and therefore the slaying of camias was justified under the circumstances his wife and coaccused on the other hand with corroboration from nestor and jonalyn babor insisted that she never laid a hand on the victim she could not herself have attacked the deceased considering that she was already wounded and weak from loss of blood all three of them nestor sony and jonalyn likewise vehemently protested that the prosecution witness felicidad duhaylungsod was nowhere at the scene of the crime when it was committed 1 in a reprise of their position at the trial appellants maintain in this appeal that the killing of the victim evangelino camias was justified on account of their having respectively acted in selfdefense and in defense of a relative unfortunately for them the evidence on record contrarily and indubitably point to their guilt in the offense charged it is elementary that selfdefense requires unlawful aggression on the part of the victim reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused to prevent or repel it and lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself the first two requisites unlawful aggression and reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel it are likewise required in the justifying circumstance of defense of a relative with the third element being that if the provocation was given by the person attacked the one making a defense had no part therein an accused relying on said justifying circumstances must prove the same by means of sufficient satisfactory and convincing evidence as the burden of proof rests upon him to establish the same he must necessarily rely on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the weakness of that of the prosecution and where the prosecution evidence as in the present appeal renders extremely doubtful the veracity of the defense version said defenses cannot be granted any evidentiary weight in the case at bar the forthright declarations of prosecution witness felicidad duhaylungsod before the trial court coupled with proof of the number of wounds that the victim sustained sets at naught the feeble reliance of appellants on the justifying circumstances of selfdefense and defense of relative true there may initially have been unlawful aggression by the victim when he attempted to rape sony babor and failing therein he vented his ire on a suprised nestor babor by attacking the latter however the sequence of proven events which transpired thereafter effectively negates the presence or applicability of this fundamental element and of the other element of reasonable means to prevent or repel that aggression at the second stage of the fray it clearly appears from the evidence that after the spouses had turned the tide against the deceased with the latter already wounded and defensively scrambling away from the house of the babors both appellants still pursued camias as soon as sony babor caught up with him near the residence of felicidad duhaylungsod she hacked the victim thrice after which nestor babor stabbed him on the chest this was exactly the scene which felicidad duhaylungsod witnessed it is therefore apparent that the deceased was then no longer the aggressor but that he was actually attempting to escape from further harm at the hands of the spouses moreover the number of the wounds sustained by the deceased negates the assertion of said justifying circumstances by appellants the autopsy report reveals that evangelino camias had sustained all of ten wounds and one even resulted in completely severing his right arm the numerous wounds also bear out the testimony of duhaylungsod to whom no ill motive has been attributed by the defense that sony babor further hacked the wounded victim thrice and that thereafter nestor babor stabbed him on the chest sony babors pretense that she had no hand at all in the slaying of the victim is soundly refuted by the positive and credible identification and attestation made by duhaylungsod regarding her direct participationconspiracy and treachery could further be deduced from the evidence on record duhaylungsod recalled that as the victim was veering away from the spouses who were closely advancing on him he fell forward to a kneeling position presumably because of his weakened condition at this point sony babor delivered three hacking blows on the deceased inflicting wounds on the latter and nestor babor followed suit shortly after sony shouted in visayan by way of exhortation   finish him off     
murder, the tusons and the villarins are more than mere neighbors in the semipermanent structures they call home in project 6 quezon city; they are also cousins this dual relationship should have fostered harmonious coexistence among them but such was not the case sometime in october 1990 accusedappellant romeo tuson and his first cousin loreto villarin were engaged in a fight over gambling matters bolo marks on the door of tusons shanty attest to the violence that attended their quarrel three days later on october 11 their differences were finally settled the brothers loreto and ceferino villarin were drunk and tipsy that night after celebrating another brothers birthday at forest hills at around 1045 pm ceferino who was seated beside the wooden window of their singlestorey house saw loreto who was clad only in his underwear make his way to the common lavatory loreto never reached his destination for he was suddenly shot in the neck by tuson who was standing by the door of his own slightlyelevated shack which was adjacent to the toilet ceferino rushed to rescue his brother but was likewise shot by tuson in the face three other prosecution witnesses heard the twin shots; two of them actually saw the shooting of ceferino by tuson ceferinos wife evelyn and nephew hernani villeta who was living with them immediately rushed to the door of their house after hearing the gunshot and saw tuson shoot ceferino in the face as the latter tried to help his brother loretos wife rosalinda heard everything but did not have the heart to look out all three testified that tuson shouted   ikaw pa    prior to the second shot when ceferino was already down he was threatened by tuson not to rise lest he be shot a second time hernani shouted and succeeded in pleading with his uncle romeo to stop forthwith tuson fled with timely medical attention by dr marida arend arugay of the east avenue medical center ceferinos life was saved the downward trajectory of the bullet extracted from his neck indicated that the assailant fired the gun from a higher elevation the same was true with the bullet that killed loreto as it entered the right side of the neck and exited between the two shoulder blades tuson claims he shot the brothers in selfdefense his story was that he was sleeping with his wife teresita and their two children on that fateful night when loreto barged into their oneroom house shouting   tayo  putangina mo    although it is not clear if it was loreto who was armed  tuson himself testified that he heard ceferino from outside the door shouting that   he has a gun    tuson asserted that he tried to wrest a gun away from loreto while grappling for possession of the gun they both fell near the threestep stairway and with loreto on top of him the went off somehow the blast sent loreto flipping over the twofoot rail guard barring the door down the three steps finally resting on the ground outside seeing that ceferino who was allegedly armed with a bladed weapon was rising he also shot him he immediately fled threw away the gun and went into hiding for nine days before surrendering to the police on october 20 1990 his story was corroborated by his wife and older sister nieves sotto no bladed weapon was recovered from the crime scene sotto testified that prior to the shooting the brothers villarin were challenging her youngest brother romeo loreto was on the stairs of romeos house telling the latter to go out because his coffin was ready all the while banging the door yet on crossexamination she admitted that she did not notice who opened the door of romeos house because she was then embracing her husband who was sleeping on the floor of their own house in the course of the trial the court below found out that not only was the evidence of the defense weak but that the prosecutions was sufficient to support the charges against the accused tuson admitted having shot the brothers villarin albeit in selfdefense for such a defense to be appreciated in favor of the accused the trial court must be satisfied that the three elements necessary to justify the acts complained of attended their commission first there must be unlawful aggression on the part of the victim second the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression must be reasonably necessary finally the person defending himself must not have provoked the victim into committing the act of aggression as correctly found by the trial court there was no unlawful aggression in this case the victims allegedly shouted threats and banged on the door of tuson but these acts hardly constitute unlawful aggression considering that the latter was within the security of his home which was surrounded by neighbors who also happened to be close relatives by tusons own account loreto barged into their house and commanded him to stand up which is far from threatening the peril feared could have emanated only from the firearm which loreto allegedly carried at the time and yet this too was vague even on the basis of tusons testimony he said that when he approached loreto ceferino who was outside shouted   he has a gun   it does not make sense for ceferino to announce to their intended victim that they had a gun it would seem more plausible that ceferino uttered the statement as a warning to his brother with the finding of absence of unlawful aggression the crimes charged can never be justified for there is nothing to prevent or repel even if there is lack of sufficient provocation on the part of tuson to make matters worse he fled immediately after the incident and went into hiding for more than a week these could not possibly be the actuations of a man claiming to be innocent of any wrongdoing to do so under the pretext of fear of retribution from other members of the victims family would not only be craven but also irrational considering that his wife and two children were left behind the evidence for the prosecution on the other hand is solid and convincing ceferino was not only an eyewitness to the slaying of his brother loreto but was himself a victim his narration of the circumstances surrounding the shooting is supported by the separate testimonies of their wives and nephew while it is true that they were tipsy on the night in question he denied that they went to tusons house and shouted there in fact loreto was simply in his underwear ready to sleep when nature called the ushaped construction of their socalled   compound   with the common toilet adjacent to romeos house directly opposite loretos required anyone wanting to use the lavatory to pass tusons house when loreto thus passed his cousins shanty which was elevated like the rest tuson who was standing by the door suddenly and without provocation shot him at nearpointblank range hernani villeta evelyn villarin and rosalinda villarin heard this first shot hernani and evelyn immediately rushed out to investigate the matter just in time to see tuson shooting ceferino as loreto lay sprawled on the ground the bullets which were fired at loreto and ceferino had downward trajectories which conformed with the relative positions of the assailant and his targets at the time of shooting the congruence between the testimonial and the physical evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that the witnesses for the prosecution were the ones telling the truth

the husband was lying down on the side of the oneroom affair dwelling hut their three children ages seven six and two and a half were also inside fe ere was towards the rear of the house at the kitchens yard transferring the small pig to a place inside the house for the evening she was around three or four brazas to where her husband was it was there that she heard a gunfire from that direction and saw the accused at a distance of around onehalf meter to the house and at the side thereof where her husband lay the accused was around three brazas to her carrying a long gun in fort position as he withdrew and ran away she dashed inside the house and saw her husband vomiting blood with injuries at the left of the neck and towards the nape she ran to the barangay poblacion to the house of one banker ballesta the son of the barangay captain who went to the place of the incident from there ballesta motored to the town and notified julio ere the victims younger brother who in turn notified the police the report was recorded in the police blotter  exh   1    it was around 800 oclock in the evening the body was brought to the towns district of p tingzon where the grieving widow told julio ere and deputy chief of police ricardo sudio of the gun wielder to be the accused the accused is long familiar to the ere spouses fe ere used to see him whenever he goes to town he resides in a farm at another barangay she told that her husband was killed because whoever makes copra for juan anuevo the accuseds nephew would be resented by the accused the victim used to make copra for juan anuevo at the latters coconut land other hired hands are residents of tubigdanao who stopped working for juan anuevo she heard that the accused prohibited them from working for juan the victim last made copra in february the month before his death julio ere testified that immediately after ballesta told him of the shooting of his brother he notified the police at the municipal hall who recorded his report  exh   1    he met fe ere his sisterinlaw later at p tingzon in town xxx xxx xxx the accused testified that the victim was a friend and they see each other often fe ere was also his friend and knows her since she was small he branded her accusation as a lie on march 9 1993 in the evening he was at home sleeping with his wife and their small child his house is in san lorenzo a barangay around five kilometers accessible only by a footpath and can be negotiated in about ten minutes by walking at a fast pace he came to know of the death of rufino ere only on the 24th of march 1993 when he was told he was subpoenaed he was always at home from march 10 1993 up to his arrest on march 27 he could not think of any reason as to why fe ere would accuse and testify to

juan anuevo is his nephew who owns two parcels of land in san lorenzo which came from the formers father his coconut land is situated between these properties of juan with whom he maintains good relationship the victim was only one of those hired to make copra by juan anuevo and the last time he made copra was in february this year nora anuevo his wife vouched for his presence at their home during the whole evening of march 9 1993 appellant assails the credibility of the main witness for the prosecution the victims wife fe ere appellant claims fe ere could not have seen her husbands assailant for while she was present at the premises nevertheless she did not see the actual shooting as she was at the back of the kitchen busy attending to a piglet and therefore had no opportunity to get a good view of the assailant the defense also laid emphasis on the fact that it was nighttime and the prosecution had not established that the victims house was situated in a place where there were no plants and trees in the surroundings which could have obstructed the moonlight from fully illuminating the scene or which might otherwise have prevented fe ere from seeing the person of the assailant thus the accused claims her identification of appellant as her husbands killer is unreliable and untrustworthy her testimony aside from being biased is unreliable and untrustworthy her testimony aside from being biased is uncorroborated and therefore also insufficient to convict appellant we disagree the record shows that fe ere was in a position to see her husbands killer her testimony was to the effect her familys dwelling was a small oneroom hut at the time she heard the gunshot she was in their yard tethering their pig the yard was near their kitchen so she was in a good position to see appellant who was at the side of the hut about three armslengths from her backing away from the house holding a long firearm in fort position and then running away said she q what

the kitchen of your house a yes sir furthermore when the incident took place it was only about 730 in the evening with bright moon providing adequate illumination which enabled fe ere to identify the appellant q now you said that you saw the accused pedrito anuevo how were you able to recognize him a because the moon was bright q how bright was the moon   a it was very bright q where was the position of the moon at that time a the moon was in position of 700 oclock and it came from the east where the sun rises q after seeing him where did he go a he ran away the trial court made note of the fact that there was a full moon the day prior to the incident ie on march 8 1993 12 fe ere was familiar with accusedappellant and thus easily recognized him she testified on direct q how long have you known this pedrito anuevo before that incident a long before because we frequently meet on the road court q how often do you meet him on the road a always whenever he goes to town q you said that he goes to town why where was he staying a in the farm q where is that farm a in san jose toward san lorenzo q in whose land a his own land during trial the accused admitted that fe ere knew him just as well as he did her and so the court a quo observed that based on the surrounding circumstances all the opportunities for a positive identification by the sole witness were present in this case the trial court found the testimony of fe ere convincing when the credibility of witnesses is at issue appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings and assessments of trial courts the credibility of witnesses is matter best assessed by the trial court which had observed their demeanor and deportment during trial findings of trial courts regarding the veracity of a testimony are given great weight and accorded high respect by this court in the absence of a showing that they were reached arbitrarily we will not disturb these findings unless there is a clear showing that facts or circumstances of weight or substance have been overlooked or misunderstood which could affect the result of the case appellant has not presented any reason why this case should be an exception to the general rule appellant claims fe ere failed to identify her husbands assailant to the police and that the shooting was recorded in the police blotter on march 9 1993 with the suspect unnamed and unidentified however the testimonies of prosecution witnesses reveal that it was julio ere the victims brother who first reported the incident to the police and at the time he did so he did not yet know who the assailant of his brother was when fe ere was investigated on the same night of the shooting she immediately identified appellant as her husbands killer this was established by the testimony of the deputy chief of police who declared that fe ere revealed to him the accused as the killer upon their return to the town that night fe eres identification of appellant is sufficient to convict him it has repeatedly been held that the testimony of a single eyewitness if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict appellant instead of introducing evidence to show that fe ere had motive to testify falsely against him even admitted that she had no reason to wrongly accuse him of the death of her husband the testimony of fe ere cannot be denied credence just because she happened to be the victims wife mere relationship of a witness to the victim doers not automatically impair his credibility and render his testimony less worthy of credence where no improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying rather the witness relationship to the victim far from rendering her testimony biased would even make it more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in seeking justice for the deceased to accuse somebody other than the real culprit second issue is the alibi airtight in the face of the overwhelming evidence againts him appellant relies on the defense of alibi he testified that he was at home sleeping with his wife and their young child when the shooting was committed his wife corroborated his story claiming that her husband was with her at home the whole night of march 9 1993 and he never left the house the accusedappellant also claims he had no motive to kill rufino ere insisting that the victim was his friend and that they knew each other quite well the rule is wellsettled that in order for the defense of alibi to prosper it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the offense was committed but it must likewise be demonstrated that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission alibi the plea of having been elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission of the felony is a plausible excuse for the accused let there be no mistake about it contrary to the common notion alibi is in fact a good defense but to be valid for purposes of exoneration from a criminal charge the defense of alibi must be such that it would have been physically impossible for the person charged with the crime to be at the locus criminis at the time of its commission the reason being that no person can be in two places at the same time the excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception where there is the least possibility of accuseds presence at the crime scene the alibi will not hold water  emphasis ours  in this case appellant admitted that the place where the crime was committed could be reached from his place in approximately 10 to 20 minutes on foot he said q how far is tubigdanao to your house in san lorenzo a it could be around two kilometers away q how many minutes would it take to negotiate from tubigdanao to your house a it could be around 20 minutes because there is no road in going there and you have only to hike but if one is fast in walking it would only take around 10 minutes q is there a footpath a yes sir in light of the foregoing testimony the trial court certainly could not be faulted for not giving weight to accusedappellants alibi besides being inherently weak for not being airtight accuseds alibi cannot prevail as against the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses likewise the testimony of appellants wife is of little value to his defense as it only corroborates his leaky alibi also alibi has been held to become less plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by the accused himself and his immediate relatives his defense of lack of motive likewise not prosper as motive is immaterial where there is direct testimony of a witness and where the culpability of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt in any event the trial court held that    i t is not that there is want of any motive at all for the killing   preferring to believe fe eres testimony to the effect that the accused had threatened the workers who made copra for accuseds nephew juan anuevo and had told them he would treat them as his  accuseds  enemies everyone but the victim desisted from making copra for juan anuevo; the victim last worked in february the month before he was killed treachery not proven however although the trial court observed that the killing is characterized by the treacherous manner it was perpetuated     the victim certainly had no opportunity to defend himself and he was in no position to mount any defensive maneuver such as would subject the accused to any risk killing a sleeping victim was considered an example par excellence of the crime qualified by treachery  citing people vs curatchia 97 scra 549 and people vs pajanustan 97 scra 699  and the circumstance surrounding the shooting of rufino ere assumes no less consideration even without it being positively shown that he was aslept  sic  the evidence fails to show that appellants attack on rufino ere was committed with treachery the most that can be said in this case is that the victim was reclining at one side of his oneroom dwelling hut when he was shot with the killer firing from outside the hut there was no evidence not even from the testimony of fe ere that the victim was asleep or that his back was turned to the accused when the latter fired the shot or was otherwise in a defenseless position all that fe ere saw was her husband vomiting blood it is elementary that alevosia to be appreciated must be proven as clearly as the elements of the crime or crimes it is alleged to qualify this the prosecution had failed to do it should have proven that the accused had consciously and deliberately employed a form of attack to ensure the consummation of his objective without risk to himself from any defense the person assaulted could have made 35 this cannot be said to have been done in the instant case on the other hand the trial court ruled out evident premeditation for lack of evidence to which we agree

murder,the prosecution established that accusedappellant and the victim josephine castro wisco were living together as husband and wife although the latter was married to a certain danilo r wisco who was working in saudi arabia on march 16 1992 at about 600 pm appellant and josephine left the latters house in sta rita macabebe pampanga to see a mutual friend josephine yabut a fish vendor in

due to multiple stabbed wounds body in defense appellant admitted that he and josephine were lovers but denied they lived together allegedly josephine ended their relationship on february 25 1992 when she learned that her husband was coming home from saudi arabia appellant wanted to forget josephine so he left pampanga the following day february 26 and stayed with his friend in nueva ecija he lived there for almost two years helping his friend tend pigs and cook salted eggs to earn a living he was later apprehended by the nueva ecija police who mistook him for the mastermind of a carnapping syndicate he learned of josephines death and of his standing warrant of arrest from the police as regards the medical evidence dr alfredo bondoc the doctor who conducted the autopsy on the victim admitted that the wounds on the victim could have been inflicted by more than one person using more than one weapon his testimony is as follows atty morales now these several wounds inflicted on the body of the victim can you determine which among them was first inflicted witness yes sir q there are several wounds which have been inflicted on the body of the victim it is possible that it could have been inflicted by several persons is that right a yes sir court it is also possible that the same wounds were inflicted by one person a yes sir court dr bondoc considering the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by josephine castro wisco would you be able to tell the court more or less the size of the blade of the weapon which was used by the assailant witness the size of the blade being used by the assailant has a minimum length of around 15 cm sir court what do you mean by the length a the blade sir court i mean the width of the blade could have been a a minimum of 15 cm sir it is the smallest wound we have seen court how about the length of the blade of the weapon which was used by the assailant were you able to determine a the minimum length of the weapon used should 12 cm sir court and the maximum length a i cannot say the maximum sir court how about the maximum width of the blade you said the minimum was 15 cm a its very hard to tell the maximum width because sometimes the injuries are slight but with large internal injury sir court dr bondoc would you able to testify as to how many weapons were used by the assailant a in this instant case the wounds inflicted were almost consistent and it is slightly possible that they were caused by one sir court it is slightly possible that he wounds inflicted were caused by the same weapon proceed atty morales so you dont also exclude the possibility dr bondoc that more than one weapon was used a no sir court what do you mean by no sir a there can be more than one weapon as long as those weapons are almost the same which i mentioned sir court meaning a minimum of 1 1/2 in width and a minimum of 12 cm in length dr bondoc testified that the victims wounds could have been inflicted by one or more weapons at the same time however he did not discount the possibility that the wounds were inflicted by one and the same weapon because the wounds were consistent in appearance appellant argues that the court should have sustained dr bondocs theory that the wounds were inflicted by several weapons because this favors the innocence of the accused the number of weapons used in stabbing josephine is immaterial the fact remains that she was stabbed and that she died because of her stab wounds the conclusion that josephines death was perpetrated by appellant has been conclusively proven by the following circumstances  1  josephine and appellant were lovers;  2  appellant was seen in possession of a fan knife before he and the victim saw yabut;  3  appellant the victim and yabut were at the aling bidang restaurant in masantol when yabut learned that the victims husband was returning from saudi arabia and because of this the lovers had a misunderstanding;  4  the victim was last seen with appellant at 1100 pm when they boarded a tricycle together towards the direction of macabebe;  5  between 1100 pm and 1200 midnight in macabebe appellant was seen coming out of the sta ritabatasan cemetery wiping his arms and hands and when startled trying to hide something behind him;  6  inside the said cemetery wiscos dead body was found full stab wounds and nearby were the crabs and shrimps yabut earlier gave her and appellant;  7  appellant fled pampanga and went into hiding in nueva ecija until his arrest almost two years later the foregoing circumstances have been satisfactorily proven by the prosecution and their combination establishes beyond reasonable doubt the conclusion that appellant indeed killed josephine against this phalanx of positive evidence appellants lame and

her mother where is that woman i am very angry with her and if i will see her i will kill her   after that jaime walked towards the direction of his houseat about the same time that raymund was observing an unruly and drunk jaime alicia respicio was informing soledad piid that virginia had a quarrel with jaime that night at alicias house soledad saw virginia crying with a reddish face which she interpreted as the result of jaimes maltreatment as virginia was their relative soledad and alicia advised her to stay with alicia for the night soledad then returned to her house by 1100 pm however alicia again reported to her that virginia disregarded their advice and instead went home however another quarrel between jaime and virginia ensued with the former threatening the latter to

went to see the body of virginia she saw jaime walking to and fro beside the cadaver but not crying she requested jaime to change the clothes of his dead wife but he did not do or say anything it was soledads companions who changed virginias clothingdr rolex gonzales medical officer iii of the abra provincial hospital conducted an autopsy on virginias cadaver while he heard stories about the victims drowning his examination revealed otherwise he observed that the victims lungs and stomach were devoid of water fluid or any debris or foreign material thus negating the theory that she drowned he noticed lacerations abrasions and hematoma on different parts of the victims body he opined that they were probably inflicted with the use of a hard object on the early morning of 15 december 1996 the wound that caused a depressed portion on the skull caused the intracerebral hemorrhage which resulted in the victims deathmelecio bolesa and cristeta bolesa maa  virginias brother and sister respectively testified having spent p30710 relative to the death and burial of their sister jaime did not share a single centavo in the expenses melecio recalled that virginia would often go to bilabila and complain that jaime would maltreat her whenever he was drunk and even make her dance nakedafter the prosecution rested its case the defense filed a demurrer to evidencewith prior leave of court on the ground that the prosecution failed to present any eyewitness to the commission of the crime or circumstantial evidence sufficient to support a conviction beyond reasonable doubt in an order of 14 may 1998the trial court denied the demurrer to evidence the trial then continued with the defense through jaime ba  and his mother linda ba  proffering a different version of the events jaime admitted to having engaged in a drinking spree at the wake of antonina babida from 900 pm to 1200 midnight of 14 december 1996 there he met his mother who was selling balut since he was so drunk that he could no longer carry his body he just sat and slept beside her mother at the gate where the wake was being held at 430 am of the following day his mother woke him up and they proceeded homejaimes house was however locked he peeped through the window and called his wife no answer came jaime therefore opted to go to his mothers house which was about a hundred meters away there he slept only to be later awakened by his mother with the news that his wife drowned he proceeded to the place where the body of his wife was found but met a police car along the way he went inside the police car found and embraced the lifeless body of his wife and cried he did not see any laceration abrasion or contusion on her body at the time jaime claimed that he could not have mauled much less killed his wife in their house on the early morning of 15 december 1996 because at the time he was still asleep beside his mother at the wake he did not attend his wifes wake and funeral at bilabila for his wifes family suspected that he was responsible for his wifes death and threatened him not to go thereit is clear from the facts established that on the night of december 14 1996 the accused jaime ba  was heavily drunk; that he maltreated his wife and acted violently against her prompting his wife virginia to seek refuge in the house of alicia respicio; that after midnight of december 14 1996 jaime ba  was angrily looking for his wife virginia that he threatened to kill his wife when he finds her even in public which caught the attention of raymond marquez barangay kagawad; that he was unruly provoking and making trouble; that he denied his wife suffered physical violence as shown in the physical injuries of the cadaver like lacerations abrasions and hematoma on her face a fractured skull; that he tried to poison and kill himself and commit suicide by drinking insecticide and that he never attended the burial of his wife at bilabila sallapadan abra for her final wake this chain of events taken together points to no other than the accused jaime ba  as the one who killed his wife virginia ba  sometime after midnight of december 14 1996  
homicide, that on april 16 1989 at about 1100 oclock in the evening at barangay malubo municipality of mahayag province of zamboanga del sur republic of the philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with intent to kill with treachery and evident premeditation while armed with a hunting knife did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously stab one felix tala inflicting upon him mortal stab wounds on the different parts of his body which caused his instantaneous death the evidence for the prosecution consisted of the declarations at the witness stand of arceli dangase francisco gumula diosdado regan and jeffrey artiaga the defense proffered the testimony of federico campuso and that of appellant himself the actual scenario from the view of the trial court is that depicted albeit briefly in the decision appealed from; viz reconstructing the sequence of events in the evening of april 16 1989 at malubo mahayag zamboanga del sur the court is morally convinced of the occurrence of the following set of facts; that the accused was standing outside the dancing hall immediately before the stabbing incident; that when the deceased felix tala went out of the dancing hall to urinate he was followed by the accused; that the deceased returned with blood all over about him and the accused run away; that the accused voluntarily surrendered to cafgu francisco gumula at the latters residence in malubo in the afternoon of april 17 1989 and confessed to the killing of felix talathe trial court in fine gave credence to the testimony of eyewitness arceli dangase that     in the evening of april 16 1989 she was tending her store a short distance from the benefit dance being then held at the market place of malubo mahayag zamboanga del sur; that felix tala had an argument with accused wilson villanueva that evening; that the accused was standing outside the dancing hall and when felix tala went out to urinate she saw the accused followed felix tala; that when felix returned his breast was already full of blood; that she shouted that felix was stabbed and pointed to the accused who then run away impressed with arceli the trial court observed that her     demeanor and testimony in court were natural and unaffected she had no reason to testify falsely against the accused to the contrary immediately after she testified the said witness talked to the accused inside the courtroom crying the court therefore has no doubt of the sincerity and veracity of the testimony of said witness appellant denied the criminal imputation against him he testified that he was at the dance hall with a lady partner  whose name strangely he could not remember  when the stabbing incident occurred he was later arrested at home without any warrant he assailed the credibility of the prosecution witnesses in the case particularly of eyewitness arceli dangase he asseverated that her testimony was full of inconsistencies the court has examined the records and it is satisfied that the court a quo has been more than judicious in giving credit to arcelis testimony arceli gave this eyewitness account of the stabbing incident q that is what you firmly believe that wilson villanueva stabbed felix because he ran away a it was wilson who stabbed felix because i saw him and after he stabbed felix he ran but it is very risky to pinpoint him but it was wilson and he ran afterwards q now how did wilson villanueva stab felix tanyola a he was holding the knife and stabbed felix q will you please demonstrate interpreter the witness demonstrated the man who stabbed was holding it on his right hand and demonstrated the act of stabbing the breast of felix tanyola and then afterwards he ran q so that your answer in number 6 which you said that you did not actually see is wrong fiscal cagoco misleading your honor the answer never categorical state that she did not see the actual stabbing your honor atty tecson yes she did not see the actual stabbing what she saw is she was already surprised why wilson ran away and what was really she saw is that felix tanyola was already holding his breast that was what she say court the affidavit does not state that she did not see but that is your conclusion atty tecson now it is very clear that he just only saw felix while he was holding his breast court in the affidavit there is no statement that she did not see atty tecson she did not actually state also that she actually saw the stabbing your honor court let it be noted in the record that in her affidavit she did not state categorically that she saw or she did not see the actual stabbingon the question of whether arceli had a companion or was alone tending the store when she saw the stabbing incident she explained q and you do not have companions in tending your store a i was there sitted  sic  q the question is do you have any companions a i have no companion it was only jaime dangase who was near me and it was then that i saw wilson stabbed and i shouted help q do you mean that jaime dangase the one who testify in this case a yes sir because he was near me and i shouted for help q and at that time you were conversing with jaime a yes sir because he was near me and i shouted for help because felix tanyola was stabbed q but wilson villanueva and felix tanyola as you have stated were standing besides each other a yes sir because he was the one who was standing next to felix and when i saw that felix was already blooded he ran and i shouted for help because felix was stabbed q but aside from wilson villanueva there were also many people around them a there were no persons around them it was only after felix was stabbed that there were persons who surrounded us then on whether appellant stabbed tala while the two were at or near the dance hall or while tala was urinating she testified q so that at the beginning of the benefit dance your attention was only focused to felix and wilson villanueva a it is benefit dance but when felix went out to urinate wilson followed him and i noticed that when he came back he was already blooded and stabbed so i shouted to help him because he was stabbed q but you said in your affidavit that wilson villanueva was only standing and now you said that villanueva went out which is now is correct a wilson was standing outside but when felix went out he followed from the dance hall and it was then that i shouted for others to help felix because he was stabbed ive even pointed him when wilson ran away and it was on the following day that he surrendered the testimony would sufficiently convey that when tala left the dance hall to urinate wilson followed and in an instant stabbed him the fact that the affidavit she has executed is deficient in some respects should be of no real moment the discrepancy between statements of the affiant in an affidavit and those made on the witness stand is not necessarily a cause for discrediting a witness exparte affidavits are generally incompleteand they do not purport to contain a complete compendium of the details of the event narrated by them there is no rule that would estop an affiant from making an elaboration of an affidavit during the trial at any rate the issue on which witness to believe is one that should be best addressed by a trial rather than by an appellate court findings of fact of a trial judge are accorded great respect and are seldom disturbed on appeal the rationale is explained in people vs yadao this court accords respect to the factual findings of the trial judge who has the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses and to determine by their demeanor on the stand the probative value of their testimonies the witnesses reveal much when they testify that is not reflected in the transcript which only records what they said but not how they said it the meaningful pause the ready reply the angry denial the elusive eyes or the forthright stare the sudden pallor when a lie is exposed or the flush of face that accentuates a sincere assertionthese and many other telltale marks of honesty or invention are not lost on the trial judge it is for this reason that his factual findings are generally not disturbed by the appellate court unless they are found to be clearly biased or arbitrary they are not so in the case at bar appellant contends that the trial court has erroneously appreciated treachery and evident premeditation in the commission of the crime the court agrees for the qualifying circumstance of treachery to be considered it must be clear that the accused has deliberately and consciously adopted means of execution that render the person attacked with no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate treachery is not presumed; it has to be proved as convincingly as the killing itself there would appear to be no substantial evidence showing that the killing was done in a treacherous manner in fact the prosecutions evidence itself would indicate that appellant and the victim had some kind of argument immediately prior to the stabbing arceli dangase stated that when she first gazed at appellant and the victim the two were standing   side by side   and when   the victim went out to urinate appellant followed him and stabbed him   she next found herself staring at the victim holding his bloodied breast and appellant starting to run away from the scene absent any evidence of a treacherous attack the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt relative to the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation even the solicitor general agrees that this circumstance has been incorrectly taken into account by the trial court evident premeditation exists when the execution of the criminal act is preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent within a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment its stages are  1  the time when the offender has determined to commit the crime;  2  an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; and  3  a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of his act in the case at bar it just so happened it would seem that appellant and the victim saw each other at the dance hall and later had an argument no evidence was shown that appellant had any previous plan to kill the victim like treachery evident premeditation should be established by clear and positive evidence mere presumptions and inferences no matter how logical and probable they might be would not be enough nighttime alleged in the information is an aggravating circumstance only when it is purposely sought by the offender it does not appear to be the case at all in this instance  
parricide, the accusedappellant admits having killed his wife but insists that he did so only after surprising her in the very act of sexual intercourse with another man however he fails to substantiate the stringent elements required by law to absolve him of criminal responsibility his defense appears no more than an amalgam of confusion contradiction and concoction the facts version of to the prosecution the facts as gathered from the testimonies of prosecution witnesses dr regino gaite danilo talisic and victoria sapyo tautho are as follows sixteenyear old danilo talisic testified that at dawn of may 8 1988 his mother janita talisic was stabbed to death with a chisel by his father jimmy talisic who afterwards displayed the bloodied weapon before their altar realizing that his mother was already dead danilo decided to bring his younger sister to their grandfathers housethey passed by the house of their aunt victoria sapyo tautho a sister of the deceased and related to her the bizarre killing the latter hurried to the house of the deceased arriving at six oclock that morning she was aghast at the bludgeoned body of her sister and the bloodstained chisel at the altarin the meantime danilo also related the killing to his paternal grandfather simon talisic who thereupon proceeded to the house of his son accusedappellant jimmy talisic and brought the latter to the military camp at tipanoy iligan citysubstantially corroborating danilos testimony victoria sagio tautho stated that she found her sisters lifeless body sprawled on the floor of their living room as well as the crimsondrenched chisel at the altar dr regino gaite examined the body of the deceased and issued the necropsy report  exhibit   b    on the stand he described the sixteen stab wounds inflicted on the victim as follows q during the examination on the 16 stab wounds you have mentioned will you please tell this honorable court how deep was the penetration of these injuries on the dead body of the victim a some were four inches deep;

brother arrived to intervene and he took joglyn out of the house accused victor did not know where his son and brotherinlaw went meanwhile accused decided to go out of the house and get some fresh air before leaving however he got his gun a 22 caliber revolver his wife tried to prevent him from leaving the house and bringing the gun with him however he prevailed over her because there were many thieves lurking in the neighborhood when he was about five  5  meters from their house he heard a commotion at the back of their house thinking that there were thieves he fired a warning shot in the air accused continued walking toward the direction of the store one hundred  100  meters from his house as he was near the store he noticed a group of people and he approached them there he saw his son joglyn macoy who uttered to his uncle cresenciano   tiyo papa is coming pleace intercept he might do something   the people at the store stood up and faced him fearing that he would be attacked he drew his gun and pointed it upwards immediately cresenciano blocked his path and grappled with him for the possession of the gun in the course of their struggle accused heard a burst of gunfire and saw his son joglyn fall to the ground then he heard cresenciano telling danilo macasero to pick up the gun all this time he was still holding his gun so the gun that fell and was picked up by danilo was not his  victor accused victor was shocked by the fact that his son was shot the people gathered in the store helped his son and brought him to the hospital his mind went blank and he simply walked home when he arrived home he inspected his gun a 22 caliber and found one  1  empty shell and five  5  live bullets left he was then sure that another gun was used in shooting his son accused hid his gun under the ipilipil trees in front of his housenot long after policemen arrived and he invited them in he was asked if he shot his son which he denied suddenly his brotherinlaw cresenciano marikit arrived and said that his son joglyn was dead on arrival at the hospital accused commented that what happened to his son was regretful together with the police officers they went to the cebu chong hua hospital afterwards accused was brought to the ramos police station cebu city where he was further investigated about the firearm and the shooting of his son all the time that he was undergoing investigation he was not apprised of his constitutional rights he was not assisted by counsel from the time he was asked searching questions in his house up to the time of the filing of the cases against him with the city prosecutors office cebu city when he was asked if he had a license for his 22 caliber revolver he replied that the person who sold the gun to him promised to secure a license for himwhen accused victor was asked in open court to identify the gun on exhibit he said that it was not his and that it was the first time he had seen that gun his gun was a 22 caliber revolver while the one presented on exhibit was a 38 caliber revolver moreover the gun on exhibit had four  4  bullets; one  1  empty shell and three  3  live bullets accused victor admitted that at the time of the shooting he was holding a gun different from the one on exhibit his gun was not licensed and the seller was following it up for him he loved his son joglyn because he was his only son he was not able to assist his son when the latter fell to the ground because his mind went blank accused victor macoy jr y midal alleges that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of illegal possession of firearm as the gun alleged by the prosecution to have been used in the shooting of his son joglyn macoy was not the same gun in his possession corollarily he could not be held responsible for his sons deaththough accused categorically denied ownership of the 38 caliber revolver presented as prosecution evidence prosecution witnesses marilou macoy cresenciano marikit and danilo macasero positively identified the gun as the weapon used by the accused on the night in question no ill motive has been established against these witnesses that might have prompted them to incriminate the accused or falsely testify against him   it is settled that when there is no showing that the principal witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by improper motive the presumption is that the witnesses were not so actuated and their testimonies are thus entitled to full faith and credit testimonies of witnesses who have no motive or reason to falsify or perjure their testimonies should be given credence  their narration of what exactly transpired on that fateful night was consistent and corroborative of each others testimony considering that as alleged by accused many people were gathered at the store when the shooting incident occurred how come that no one saw his brotherinlaw was armed with a gun this leaves us with no other conclusion than that accused victor concocted the twogun theory to avoid criminal liability  
parricide, that on or about the 30th day of september 1990 in quezon city philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with evident premeditation did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and employ personal violence upon the person of one irma aspurias de vera his wife by then and there strangling her neck with a sash thereby causing her instantaneous death to the damage and prejudice of the heir of the said irma aspurias de vera contrary to lawhe pleaded   not guilty   to the accusation the prosecutions account of the incident may be narrated as follows in the afternoon of 30 september 1990 irma aspurias de vera the young housewife of the accused was at home with household helper francisca eugenio  francing  their tenant lorna anteola the accuseds sister rowena de vera jesuitas and the latters husband arnel jesuitas at about 300 pm irmas husband accused ronald de vera arrived ronald asked irma who was then at the kitchen with francing and lorna to join him in the bedroom upstairs in order to   discuss an important matter   within minutes lorna heard a commotion in the couples bedroom she could hear that the two were engaged in a shouting match then there was complete silence after a while sensing that all was well again lorna went upstairs to her surprise she saw ronald assisted by arnel carrying a disabled irma out of the room the latter was brought to the quezon city medical center where she was pronounced dead on arrival looking over at the couples bedroom lorna and francing saw that the place was in dissaray the quezon city police conducted that evening an investigation of the incident spo1 jose gil gregorio made an ocular inspection he reported that the builtin cabinets in the couples bedroom were open the bedsheets were crumpled and clothes and perfume bottles were scattered all over the place in the medicolegal examination conducted on 04 october 1990 by the police the cause of death was said to be asphyxia by hangingthe national bureau of investigation    nbi    at the request of the commission on human rightsundertook its own investigation of the case irmas body was exhumed and a second autopsy was conductedthis time the cause of death was found to be   asphyxia compatible with strangulation  the defense sought to convince the trial court that irma took her own life its version of the incident follows ronald and his wife had a heated argument about their failure to attend the wedding of his sister rowena to arnel jesuitas irma and rowenas relationship concededly was strained according to ronald irma became hysterical during the confrontation ronald tried but failed to calm down his wife he later left the room purportedly   to get his toothbrush from the bathroom   when he returned he found the door of their room already locked he knocked at the door repeatedly but irma would not let him in ronald went downstairs and after about ten minutes he went back but he still could not get in finally he decided to enter the room through the window he found irma sitting with her head down and motionless he tapped her on the shoulder and called her name but she did not respond he felt her pulse he noticed a sash around her neck which was tied to an iron bar of the cabinet ronald removed the sash from the cabinet and took it off from irmas neck he then with the help of rowena and arnel rushed irma to the hospital where the attending physicians tried but failed to revive his wifedr renato bautista the medicolegal officer of the nbi concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia compatible with strangulation while dr bautista conceded that an autopsy on a fresh cadaver would normally be more reliable in determining the cause of death than that conducted at the later time much would depend however he said on how the autopsy was undertaken and on the condition of the cadaver it would appear that the postmortem investigation on the cadaver conducted by the nbi was decidedly more extensive and exhaustive than the cursory examination previously made by the police dr bautista testified q what made you conclude mr witness that the cause of death was asphyxia compatible with strangulation a well sir aside from the absence of any ligature mark on the neck the presence of the different injuries located on the neck and the findings on the inferior third of the thyroid cartilage towards and including superior part of the first portion of the trachea revealed marked congestion i believed that the cause of death was strangulation xxx xxx xxx q mr witness based on your findings how was the strangulation done in your opinion mr witness a it was done manually sir q what made you conclude mr witness that it was done manually a well sir since the different contusedabrasions on the neck of the victim made me conclude said opinion because this could have been caused these contusedabrasions could have been caused by fingernails sir xxx xxx xxx q how about these things which you are referring to as ligature marks is that not also a specific example of vital evidence that is usually tempered with or even destroyed by the process of embalming a no your honor q could you enlighten us why you say so a on the contrary there are injuries especially these ligature marks which might appear on the cadaver which might not be seen immediately after the death of the victim and in its particular case if there were ligatures marks present on the neck i should have readily seen it q could you kindly explain the nature of the ligature marks a a ligature mark your honor is the inflictment of the ligatures on the skin q is it usually inflicted or produced in the skin a because of the tightness on the particular portion of the skin ligature mark will leave its mark therefore there is that situation now if it is a case of soft material let us say the linen in most cases that dont leave a mark but definitely on the autopsy you will see that there is a vital reaction underneath the skin q what is the vital reaction underneath the skin a there is reddening of the muscle tissue sometimes congestive sometimes there is fractures on the trachea q could you still see the reddening or the congestion left by such even after embalming a yes sir q so these marks of evidence can survive the process of embalming a yes sir q and in your autopsy none of these evidence is present in this particular victim a there was sir q what was that a there was a slight congestion and there was a marked congestion of the lower third of the thyroid cartilage towards and including the superior part of the first portion of the trachea revealed marked congestion  cricoid cartilage xxx xxx xxx atty martinez q will not the lapse of time of about one and one half month between death and autopsy erase or blurred the trace of the ligature marks a may i qualify my answer in cases of victim that were not embalmed and submerged in water yes but in case of embalming no q so if the victim is not embalmed and not submerged in water it will erase the marks a yes sir q and you would like us to understand that the embalming would preserve ligature marks a yes sir q and you are 100% certain that the cadaver had undergone embalming a yes sir and there were no ligature marks in the neck court i have some clarificatory questions  to the witness  q you said that there were no ligature marks in the neck is that correct a yes sir xxx xxx xxx pros  to the witness  q doctor in your opinion do the contusions and abrasions that appeared in the cadaver could have been selfinflicted atty martinez  to the court  objection not covered in the cross pros i withdraw  to the witness  q in your opinion were the contusions and abrasions   i reform in your opinion were the contusedabrasions appearing in the cadaver and referred to by you in exhibit f1 selfinflicted or not atty martinez  to the court  objection not covered in the crossexamination court ruling may answer a no sir pros  to the witness  q what made you conclude doctor that the contusedabrasions were not selfinflicted a it is very hard for an individual to strangulate oneself manually because in the process there will be a diminish flow of oxygen to the brain resulting to the state of unconsciousness whereby releasing the said strangled hold on ones neck q in your autopsy and examination of the cadaver did you notice any breakage in the trachea a none sir q in your opinion what could be the evidences that would appear in the neck or in the trachea if a person died by hanging a usually there is a presence of ligature marks the presence of the knot either on the left side or at the right side of the neck and no evidence of fracture of the hyoid bone and in some cases there is fracture on the lower portion of the thyroid in such a way that it was vertical as to wherever the knot is located q did you observe these marks that you stated in the cadaver of the victim a no sirrelative to the contention that the condition of the cadaver could have been materially altered in the process of embalming dr bautista explained; court let me go to the contusedabrasions that you referred to in your direct examination you said that these can be caused by fingernails could that have been caused by some other thing that is other than fingernails a there is a possibility your honor q what is the possible competent cause of such contusedabrasions other than fingernails a pieces of wood sir q so you can give an example other than fingernails a i would say a small piece of wood for example pieces of woods with bristles hard enough to cause i mean three pieces of wounds on the right and two on the left side of the neck q nothing in the process of embalming could have possibly cause that contusedabrasions a nothing a possibility exists your honor in the use of suturing materials q and this suturing materials are normally used or part of the equipment of the embalmer a yes sir q in fact the embalmer can not proceed without suturing materials a yes sir q and these suturing materials which are normally used by the embalmer are usually particularly in the neck of the cadaver a no your honor q what particular part are usually dealt with suturing materials by the embalmer a they can make incision in the left side of the neck where they inject the formalin to the brain and also an incision on the thigh now if this was caused by the suturing materials there could be no reaction q so the person is dead a yes sir q but in the process of embalming in order to reach the carotid the embalmer would be using the head in doing that a yes sir q and so he would be doing a manual handling of the neck a yes sir q and in fact the embalmer would appear to be strangulating the cadaver so as he will reach the carotid is that correct a no sir q why not a to the point that the embalmer will reach on the lateral portion q but the possibility is that there is a manual handling of the neck that can cause contusedabrasions as he tried to reach the carotid a yes sirit might be stressed that dr bautista in making his examination and in identifying the cause of death did not fail to take into account the wounds which were apparently inflicted after irmas death such as the incise wound on the right side of her neck and the wound on the wrist of the left side on the anterolateral aspect

and 16 45 cm wd incised d/3 posterior  p 57 rollo  dr fernandez testified that  based on the abovedescribed wounds  the assailant could have been positioned at the back of the victim accusedappellant had a completely different version of the incidents that led to aurelios death he contended that at around 2 oclock in the afternoon of january 24 1997 he was at the bartolina of the provincial jail in cabanatuan city where he himself was detained for another crime of murder aurelio arrived fuming mad and cursing him then aurelio boxed him and he retaliated while they were exchanging punches aurelio pulled out a knife but he was able to wrestle the knife from aurelio he thereupon likewise stabbed aurelio he could not remember how many times he stabbed aurelio but he admitted that he had to be restrained by another inmate francisco caballero from inflicting further injuries on aurelio however the intervention came too late as the fatal blows had already been delivered on aurelio the trial court did not give credence to the plea of selfdefense as the evidence showed that it was the accused who provoked aurelio by giving him menacing looks and because the 16 stab wounds suffered by aurelio negate selfdefense manifesting instead a determined effort to kill the victim for selfdefense to prosper the accused must positively show that there was a previous unlawful and unprovoked attack which placed his life in danger and forced him to inflict more or less severe wounds upon his assailant employing therefor reasonable means to resist the attack  people vs real gr no 121930 june 14 1999  in the case at bar accusedappellant did not suffer any injury not even a slight scratch from the hands of the victim his life could not have been in danger and the butchering of aurelio can not in any way be justified as defense of ones self the intent to kill was patent that there was a determined effort to kill aurelio is glaring from the 16 stab wounds sustained by the victim a number of which were located in some vital parts of his body thus in people vs baniel  275 scra 472  we held that the nature location and number of wounds inflicted on the victim belie and negate the claim of selfdefense in baniel there were 11 wounds while here there were 16 wounds in different parts of the body of the victim such as his heart lungs and abdomen the gravity of those wounds is indicative of a determined effort to kill and not just to defend oneself in his second assigned error accusedappellant faults the court a quo for not appreciating incomplete selfdefense in his favor when his defense of self failed however even in incomplete selfdefense there must be unlawful aggression attributable to the victim for the said plea to be appreciated by the courts  people vs agapinay 186 scra 601  unlawful aggression presupposes an actual sudden and unexpected attack or an imminent danger thereof and not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude  people vs cario 288 scra 404 cited in people vs real supra  aurelios alleged anger and vitriolic remarks against accusedappellant are not the unlawful aggression contemplated by law and jurisprudence that would justify accusedappellant killing aurelio we however agree with the office of the solicitor general that treachery can not be appreciated in this case for failure of the prosecution to establish the same beyond reasonable doubt where no particulars are shown as to the manner by which the aggression was committed or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed treachery can in no way be established from mere suppositions drawn solely from circumstances prior to the aggression  people vs narit 197 scra 334 jolly the victims wife who allegedly witnessed her husbands killing did not see how the fight between aurelio and accusedappellant started when she came out of her husbands room to answer his pleas for help accusedappellant had commenced stabbing the victim with a balisong treachery can not be presumed it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself  people vs nonoy felix et al gr no 126914 october 1 1998

homicide, this case originated from the information filed against accusedappellants jesse torre aka   sasot   and juliver chua aka   botyok   along with coaccused leo macaliag which alleged that on or about april 16 1995 in the city of iligan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the said accused conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other armed with a deadly weapon by means of treachery and evident premeditation and with intent to kill did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault stab and wound one brian jalani thereby inflicting upon him the following physical injuries to wit  cardio respiratory arrest  hypovolemic shock r shoulder r infrascapular area l lumbar all penetrating which caused his death the prosecution relied for the most part on the testimony of eyewitness anacleto moste who related in open court the relevant incidents of that fateful night of april 16 1995 according to him he was then watching a political rally at purok rosal villaverde iligan city on or about 930 oclock in the evening when he heard a certain david who was in a state of panic asking for help because someone was being stabbed near baslayan creek not too distant from where the rally was taking place when he arrived at the scene he saw three  3  men attacking a lone victim he was able to recognize the three  3  accused as the perpetrators as well as the hapless victim one brian jalani for they were all personally known to him there was adequate lighting coming from a nearby lamp post and witness moste was only a mere eight  8  to ten  10  meters away from them furthermore there were no obstructions to his line of vision in describing the positions of the accused relative to the victim witness moste testified that accused torre was holding the neck of victim jalani from the latters back while the other two accused chua and macaliag were to the victims right and left taking turns in stabbing him he shouted at the perpetrators three  3  times before accused torre pushed the victim into the creek after which all the three  3  accused fled towards the direction of purok gumamela moste was about to chase them but decided against it when he heard the cries of the victim who was sinking into the mud and gasping for breath at the same time bleeding profusely from his stab wounds moste tried to solicit the aid of some onlookers shouting for help as he himself started to drown in the mud while striving to keep victim jalani from sinking finally three workers from dado lechon took pity and pulled moste and jalani out of the muddy creek after some difficulty in securing a vehicle the victim was finally brought to the dr uy hospital for treatment but he  jalani  succumbed to death shortly thereafter by then witness moste had already left the hospital to notify jalanis mother and to report the incident to one spo4 lubang who happened to be mostes neighborthe prosecution also presented dr livey villarin to identify the necropsy report the doctor testified that the victim sustained six  6  stab wounds in all three  3  in front and three  3  at his back; the most fatal of which was the one on the victims chestthe final witness for the prosecution was spo4 antonio lubang who was at the time of the incident the assistant chief of the special investigating unit of precinct 4 of the iligan city police command he testified that at 100 oclock in the early morning of april 17 1995 he was awakened by witness moste and a certain rene alasagas who reported the stabbing incident involving the victim brian jalani and the three accused he further averred that upon investigation other witnesses positively identified macaliag as one of the perpetrators he was also able to interview one jeffrey yorong who stated that had he not been able to escape he would have been the first victim of the same perpetrators that nightthere were no immediate arrests since all three accused had fled the vicinity it was only on february 1 1996 or almost ten  10  months later that accused juliver chua was apprehended the other two accused leo macaliag and jesse torre were brought under the jurisdiction of the trial court some four  4  months thereafter upon their arraignment all three accused pleaded not guilty interposing the defense of alibi for his part accused juliver chua argued that he could not have been in the vicinity of the crime because he was then dancing at a disco in tambacan iligan city; that he only returned to villaverde iligan city in the early hours of the morning of april 17 1995; that he even met prosecution witness moste along the way where the latter allegedly asked him  chua  if he knew the whereabouts of leo macaliag and jesse torre on crossexamination accused chua testified that on or about 110 in the morning on his way home from the disco he met coaccused leo macaliag and jesse torre at aldo arts and signs both of whom persuaded him to accompany them to purok manuang mahayahay iligan city it was there where he first learned that brian jalani had been stabbed to death by macaliag and torre allegedly with the participation of one jun tacastacas and michael pato who were then having a drinking session he decided to go home because he was afraid that he would be implicated in whatever crime macaliag and the others had committedaccused chuas alibi was corroborated by his girlfriend carla garces she testified that she was with chua at the disco on the night of the incident and that they were together the whole time they left the disco together at about 100 oclock in the morning parting ways at the traffic light at quezon avenuenext to testify on chuas behalf was his mother antonia chua who related that at 1000 oclock in the evening of april 16 1995 she went to the disco to fetch her son but she left him in the company of his girlfriend carla garces who agreed to accompany him home the elder chua further stated that her son arrived home at 130 oclock in the morning of the following dayon the part of accused jesse torre his mother rosita torre testified that at the time of the incident jesse was with her at their home sleeping until the following morning because he had a fever after he recovered from his illness accused torre left for cagayan de oro city where he worked vending peanuts until he and coaccused leo macaliag were arrested in june of 1996accused jesse torre reiterated that he was at home sick with fever on the night of the tragic incident he denied knowing the victim brian jalani while averring that he met coaccused chua for the first time when both were already incarcerated in the city jail he also refuted earlier testimony that he and macaliag were notoriously known as partners in crime saying that they were mere acquaintances and contrary to accused chuas earlier allegation torre said he was not with the group of macaliag tacastacas pato and chua in barrio manuang mahayahay iligan city in the early morning of april 17 1995when it came time for accused leo macaliag to testify he asserted that at the time of the incident he was home drinking beer with his father he only learned of the incident when accused chua came knocking and asked if he  chua  could hide in the macaliag house for a while he recalled that chuas clothes were bloodied and covered with mud prompting him to refuse chuas request shortly thereafter spo4 antonio lubang and prosecution witness moste arrived asking the whereabouts of leo macaliags younger brother roel who was then attending the political rally he further averred that he stayed home for several weeks before moving to cagayan de oro city where he also found a job selling peanuts until he was apprehendedthe last witness for the defense was one estela minister a neighbor of accused macaliag who testified that at 1100 oclock in the evening of april 16 1995 she was doing her laundry in front of her house she corroborated macaliags testimony that accused juliver chua came to the macaliag residence but chua was harangued by leos mother who scolded him  chua  and denied him entry that upon seeing chuas dirty clothes and bloodied hands she discontinued her washing fearful that chua would returnin support of the first and second assigned errors the accusedappellants argued that while it is the rule that conclusions and findings of fact of the trial court are binding and are generally not disturbed on appeal said rule is not without exception such as when the trial court ignored and overlooked facts of such weight and influence which could alter the result if consideredthe appellants submit that their case is an exception to the general rule for the trial court overlooked and ignored the fact that the testimony of the alleged eyewitness anacleto moste was patently incredible and sadly lacking in truth candor and spontaneityin particular the accusedappellants found it hard to believe that moste knowing that the assailants were supposedly   police characters   could summon the courage to shout at them and even contemplate running after them to the accusedappellants such a show of bravery runs counter to the ordinary course of human experience secondly they pointed out that mostes testimony did not agree with the medical findings that the victim sustained only six  6  stab wounds which in their opinion was too few considering that some amount of time had elapsed since a certain david first witnessed the stabbing until mostes arrival at the scene furthermore mostes testimony that there were no policemen or bodyguards during the political rally at purok rosal is not to be believed since it is public knowledge that there are always bodyguards or police escorts protecting the candidates during rallies the accusedappellants contentions are bereft of merit the trial court based its judgment on the credible and overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution thus we find no reason to disturb the conclusions or findings of fact of the trial court first the bravery or even heroism of eyewitness moste should not be belittled by the appellants apparent lack of faith in the inherent goodness of human beings while it cannot be denied that not all men are heroes neither are all men cowards besides what was in mostes testimony that was unbelievable he admitted that his initial reaction was fear but such fear did not paralyze him to inaction or apathy instead the better and more compassionate part of his being drove him to perform a civic if not moral duty eyewitness moste is not a stranger to violence or civic duty he was once a member of the philippine constabulary assigned in lanao del surand later with the pnpand as such he must have witnessed countless violent acts while relying on inner courage to preserve the life and limb of others given the circumstances as well as the character and experience of eyewitness moste we find nothing incredible in his reaction to the incident and his consequent testimony while witnessing a crime is an unusual experience which draws varying reactions from different people it is wellestablished that there can be no clear cut standard form of behavior or response that can be expectedfortunately for the prosecution eyewitness moste is possessed of better qualities than most men no amount of nonchalance or even condescension on the part of the accusedappellants can diminish eyewitness mostes apparent selflessness as well as credibility the fact that the victim sustained only six  6  stab wounds considering the amount of time that had elapsed is irrelevant to mostes credibility as a witness the length of time that a crime takes to accomplish is never an indication of the number or severity of the wounds that the perpetrators can inflict on a victim it is sufficient that eyewitness moste saw and recognized the appellants while they were engaged in the dastardly deed of stabbing the victim besides the victim also sustained abrasions apart from the multiple stab wounds as testified to by the doctor who conducted the autopsyit could even be concluded that said injury was sustained while the victim tried to fight off his assailants the victims resistance obviously slowed down the accusedappellants in the perpetration of their crime be that as it may this supposed inconsistency is too minor and insignificant to affect the credibility of moste as a witnessbesides such a perceived inconsistency makes mostes testimony even more credible the rule is wellsettled that inconsistencies and contradictions which are minor trivial and inconsequential cannot impair the credibility of the witness on the contrary they only serve to strengthen the veracity of his categorical straightforward and spontaneous testimonyconsequently it is of no moment that eyewitness moste did not see any policemen or bodyguards of the candidates at the political rally this argument is too trivial to be entertained it has no bearing at all on the crime committed and it is obvious that the accusedappellants are merely clutching at straws to bolster a very tenuous attack on the eyewitness credibility given the weakness of the accusedappellants arguments impugning the credibility of eyewitness moste the trial court did not err in giving full weight and credence to his testimony the factual findings of the trial court based on eyewitness mostes testimony deserves the respect of this court and must be accorded finalityin the absence of any indication that the trial court overlooked some material fact or gravely abused its discretion we see no compelling reason to interfere with the trial courts assessment of the eyewitness credibilityin the second assigned error accusedappellants contend that the prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt this contention is equally without merit even though moste is the lone eyewitness to testify his testimony is sufficient to convict the accused since his testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity spontaneously and naturally delivered in a straightforward mannerbesides the accusedappellants never questioned eyewitness mostes motives for testifying against them there was no indication that mostes motives were improper such that he would be driven to falsely testify against the accusedappellants under solemn oath it would run counter to the natural order of events and of human nature and contrary to the presumption of good faith for a prosecution witness to falsely testify if the accused is truly innocentmoreover the lone testimony of eyewitness moste having been found credible and positive is sufficient to convict the appellants for the truth is established not by quantity but by the quality of his testimonybe that as it may the accusedappellants argue that there was reasonable doubt because their defense of alibi was supported by candid and credible testimony while admitting that the defense of alibi is inherently weak such defense was sufficiently proven by the accusedappellants and their witnesses the required elements for alibi to be appreciated are  1  to prove the accuseds presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime; and  2  to demonstrate that it would thus be physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crimeaccusedappellant juliver chua claimed that he was at a disco with his girlfriend at the time of the stabbing incident his corroborative witnesses were his girlfriend carla garces and his mother antonia chua accusedappellant jesse torre claimed that he was at home sick with fever a declaration which his mother rosita torre confirmed an examination of the accusedappellants defense of alibi reveals the same to be selfserving and undeserving of any weight in law the appellants failed to present other witnesses to substantiate their alibi thus their alibi was not sufficiently proven in the absence of credible corroboration from disinterested witnessesit is a wellentrenched rule that when an accuseds alibi can only be confirmed by his relatives and friends who may not be impartial witnesses his denial of culpability of affirmative testimony merits scant consideration especially in the face of affirmative testimony of an eyewitness as to the accuseds presence in the crime sceneit has been uniformly held time and again that alibi and denial is worthless and cannot prevail over positive identification that is categorical consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitnessmoreover since the accusedappellants alibi was established only by themselves their relatives and friends their denial of guilt should be treated with the strictest scrutinywhile they claimed that the accusedappellants were at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime they could not prove that it was physically impossible for the accusedappellants to be at the scene of the crime as found by the trial court to wit there exists no physical impossibility in instances where it would take the accused only fifteen to twenty minutes by jeep or tricycle or some one and a half hours by foot to traverse the distance between the place where the accused allegedly was at the time of the commission and the scene of the crime recently the highest court has ruled that there can be no physical impossibility even if the distances between the two places is merely two  2  hours by bus  people vs abuyan jr gr no 9525455 july 1992; people vs pidia 249 scra 687  the testimony of accused juliver chuas mother  antonia chua  and his sweetheart  carla garcia  are bereft of any proof that accused juliver chua could not have been at the scene of the crime on the said date at around 930 in the evening  
homicide, roberto morales an auto mechanic at the victory rice mill testified that on july 25 1993 at around 700 pm he was at a sarisari store beside said rice mill at cabatuan isabela he was there drinking beer with gaudencio pagon romeo tindenilla rice mill security guard arellano antonio cordova rudy and the victim andres ventura an hour later the storeowner named riza requested andres to gather the empty bottles of beer romeo resented the act of andres of getting the bottles in front of him thus a verbal tussle ensued this heightened into a fistfight between andres and romeo because of the punches received from andres romeo fell suddenly arellano approached andres and stabbed the latter on the right side with a pointed doublebladed instrument andres then attempted to chase arellano but failed as the latter was able to escape into the compound of the victory rice mill andres sat down held his side and shouted for help seeing andres serious wound he  morales  and the others brought him to the bucag hospital it was there that andres died an hour laterantonio cordova corroborated morales testimony also a laborer at the victory rice mill cordova narrated that on the night of the alleged crime he was at rizas store with roberto morales rudy senias gaudencio pagon romeo tindenilla alias nonoy and andres ventura they were there since 500 in the afternoon as they were waiting for their wages after they had each consumed a bottle of beer the storeowner asked andres to gather the empty bottles while andres was gathering the bottles an argument broke out between andres and romeo the two then started exchanging blows as romeo fell arellano emerged from the rear right side of andres and stabbed andres with a doublebladed weapon hitting the latter below the right nipple andres then sat down held the right side of his body and told people around that his body was painful arellano on the other hand fled to the rice mill antonio reported the incident to the police together with morales gaudencio and another person he brought andres to the bucag hospital in cauayan in a police car it was antonio who told the victims mother about the incidentthe prosecution also submitted in evidence the medical certificate issued by dr eduardo bucag despite the absence of a medicolegal testimony the contents of the same were admitted by the defense without objectionthe medical certificate reveals that ventura died as a result of a stab wound on the upper right side of his body this is to certify that ventura andres 18 y/o male from cabatuan isabela was admitted on 72593 because of stab wound at the  upper quadrant of the abdomen on admission he was hypotensive & pale immediate resuscitation was done thru an emergency exploratory laparotomy that was performed in the operative findings showed massive blood within the peritoneal cavity stomach and small bowel about 34 liters of blood was evacuated there was transection of the hepatic artery and or postal vein penetrating wound at the duodenum and pancreas intraoperatively he went into cardio respiratory failure and was revived around 30 minutes from the time he was out of the operating room he went into cardio respiratory arrest and was pronounced dead at 115 am  72693 the prosecution having rested its case counsel for the defense made an oral demurrer to evidence and moved for the dismissal of the case as far as accused tindenilla was concerned on the ground that the prosecution failed to show complicity between the two accused personsthe prosecution concurred in this motion hence the trial court promulgated a partial decision acquitting accused tindenilla of the crime charged on the grounds that the injury inflicted by appellant on the victim   was the product of his sole initiative   and that the prosecution failed to prove conspiracy between accusedappellant and tindenilla for his part the appellant interposed alibi and denial as defenses witness romeo tindenilla testified that he arrived at rizas store between 800 and 830 pm on july 25 1993 already there were andres roberto antonio gaudencio and rudy andres told romeo that he would box him romeo asked andres why picked up the bottle of beer he was drinking and turned his back with the intention of leaving andres nonetheless boxed romeo on his back causing the latter to fall down and lose consciousness when andres told romeo that he would box him arellano was no longer around as he had gone to the compound of the rice mill in fact when romeo arrived at the store arellano who had gone from the store was already entering said compound they met each other on the road outside the store romeo was still   not fully conscious   when the police brought him to the headquarters he only learned at dawn that andres had been stabbedtestifying for his own defense arellano swore that at 730 pm on july 25 1993 he was in calaocan cabatuan isabela to pay respect to the dead grandfather of his friend arthur corpuz he stayed there with arthur for ten minutes riding on a motorcycle he and arthur returned to cabatuan arriving there at 800 pm arellano went directly to the victory rice mill upon alighting from the motorcycle roberto morales who was at the canteen three meters away from the gate of the rice mill called him roberto offered him a bottle of beer at the canteen were gaudenio pagon and rudy senias aside from roberto andres ventura was not there arellano stayed in the canteen for only ten minutes and then he proceeded to the victory rice mill on his way to the rice mill arellano met romeo who was going out of the rice mill to go to the canteen the security guard on duty at that time was mario guillermo arellano was having his dinner when a laborer in the rice mill named randy informed him that romeo was mauled and that andres was stabbed andres was shocked to learn from randy that he  arellano  had been pinpointed as the person who stabbed andres a few minutes later the police arrested him he and tindenilla were transported to the police station in the same vehicle that brought the victim to the hospitalmario guillermo the security guard on 24hour duty at the rice mill narrated that on the night of july 25 1993 at around 830 in the evening he was inside the victory rice mill compound when he heard some people quarreling outside he took a peek and from a distance of about fifteen meters from the gate he saw the victim saying   adda tamak adda tamak   meaning   i am injured i am injured   initially he testified that it was at that precise moment that he saw arellano entering the victory rice mill although later he changed his testimony and stated that around five minutes had elapsed after arellano had entered the gate when he heard someone shouting outside guillermo had opened the small opening in the big gate after hearing arellano knock at the gate three timesthe prosecution and the defense presented contradictory accounts of the events leading to the death of andres ventura and this court has invariably held the opinion of the trial court as to which version of the commission of the crime should be believed is entitled to great respect the oftrepeated rationale born of judicial experience is that the trial judge who heard the witnesses testify and had the occasion to observe their demeanor on the stand was in a vantage position to determine who of the witnesses deserve credencea close examination of the records reveals no justification to depart from the trial courts findings on the issue of credibility appellant asserts that the testimonies of prosecution witnesses are   not free from doubt   he stresses that roberto morales and antonio cordova had been drinking beer for two and a half hours and therefore their   observation of the event could have been faulty or mistaken  the credibility of said witnesses could have been adversely affected had there been proof as to how drunk they were however appellant failed to show that intoxication had so debilitated their senses to the point of negating their claim of having seen andres attackerhence the credibility of said witnesses remain untarnished appellant likewise failed to show any illmotive on the part of witnesses roberto morales and antonio cordova for testifying against him there being no showing of improper motive on the part of roberto and antonio for identifying the accused as the perpetrator of the crime the presumption is that they were not so actuated and their testimonies are entitled to full faith and creditboth prosecution witnesses clearly identified accusedappellant as the person who stabbed the victim both roberto morales and antonio cordova worked at the victory rice mill where appellant was a security guard hence they were familiar with each other both were categorical in their declaration that it was appellant who stabbed andres ventura roberto morales testified thus qwhat was the cause of the altercation between romeo tindenilla and andres ventura if you know abecause romeo resented the act of andres in getting the bottles in front of romeo and a verbal hustle  sic  followed sir qafter that what happened next athey had a fist fight and romeo tindenilla fell down sir qwhen romeo tindenilla fell down do you know what happened athen immediately arellano came near them and stabbed andres ventura at his side of his body sir  witness pointing at his right side of his body parallel to the arm just above the waist  qwho is this arellano whom you referred who immediately got near andres ventura and stabbed him at his right side athe security guard sir qis he the same person whom you pointed earlier as edison arellano ayes sir xxxqand only one fist blow was given by tindenilla to ventura is that what you mean ayes sir qand when ventura retaliated that blow was the one which felled  sic  tindenilla is that what you mean ayes sir qand before andres ventura was stabbed where was edison arellano ahe was behind the victim sir court proceed atty foronda qif you say that andres ventura was stabbed by edison arellano did you actually see edison arellano stabbed  sic  andres ventura ayes sir qwhat hand did arellano use right or left in stabbing andres ventura aright hand sir  witness swinging his right hand from his side going to the direction of the left  qwhere did the weapon came  sic  from ai do not know sir when i saw him he  w as already holding the weaponcorroborating morales testimony antonio cordova testified on crossexamination as follows qyou said that edison arellano stabbed andres ventura at what point after romeo tindenilla was struck down did the stabbing occur aless than one minute sir qwhen romeo tindenilla was being helped to his feet was andres ventura already been stabbed ayes sir court qwhere did the security guard edison arellano come from before he stabbed andres ventura afrom the rear sir of andres ventura qwho were andres ventura facing when he was stabbed by the security guard arellano aberting i and gaudencio sir qand in relation to ventura where was the fallen body of nonoy ain front of andres sir court proceed atty foronda qdid you actually see edison arellano stab andres ventura ayes sir qyou said that the assailant   biglang sumulpot   or suddenly appeared you mean to say you did not see the assailant prior to his sudden appearance ai saw him sir qwhat do you mean by   biglang sumulpot   ahe immediately attacked sir the victim  biglang sumugod positive identification where categorical and consistent without any showing of illmotive on the part of the eyewitnesses testifying on the matter prevails over alibi and denial which if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and selfserving evidence undeserving of weight in lawthe witnesses having positively identified the appellant the latters defense of alibi cannot hold water no jurisprudence in criminal cases is more settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and the same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crimeappellant however insists that guillermo was a credible witness hence the trial court should have given more weight to his testimony after a careful examination of guillermos testimony we fail to see how the same even if we were to give it full weight and credit can rebut the prosecutions version as to the killing of andres in fact said testimony is consistent with the narration of the prosecution witness morales that after stabbing ventura arellano escaped into the rice mill and that ventura tried to catch him but failed due to the injury sustained atty foronda qwhat did you do when you heard people quarreling outside ai peeped from the place where i was on duty sir qwhen  sic  did you see when you peeped ai saw the victim saying   adda tamak adda tamak    meaning   i am injured i am injured    sir court qwhy was the place where the victim was shouting lighted ait was dark your honor qhow far is the place where he was shouting from the place where you peeped aabout fifteen meters your honor court proceed atty foronda qwhen you saw this person shouting   adda tamak   meaning   i am injured   do you know where edison arellano was at that point in time ahe was already inside the victory rice mill sir prosecutor cacatian may we please spread  sic  on record the ilocano words used by the witness your honor court  all right you quote the ilocano words   sumbrek idin idiay victory rice mill   meaning he was already entering the victory rice mill  as corrected by the trial court the translation of guillermos ilocano testimony that accusedappellant was entering the rice mill when guillermo heard the victims remark that he was injured only implies that the interval of time between that remark and accusedappellants entering the compound of the rice mill was immediate that translation supports the prosecutions theory that after stabbing the victim accusedappellant ran to the rice mill neither does tindenillas testimony create any doubt as to the culpability of the appellant appellant harps on the trial courts failure to appreciate romeo tindenillas testimony that appellant was no longer at the sarisari store when the fist fight started q when andres ventura told you that he will box you until the time he actually boxed you was edison arellano within the vicinity of the sarisari store a he was no longer there sir q where was he then if you know a he went inside the compound sir q how do you know that he was already inside the compound a because when i arrived at the store i saw him entering the compound of the victory rice mill sirhowever it must be remembered that at the time ventura was stabbed tindenilla as he himself admits was already unconscious his testimony that arellano had already gone to the rice mill is of no moment considering the short distance between the rice mill and the sarisari store arellano could have easily shuttled between the two places in fact this is consistent with witness cordovas statement that when the fistfight ensued between tindenilla and ventura the appellant was not in the vicinity and it was only when tindenilla fell to the ground that appellant appeared from nowhere and stabbed ventura all told this court is of the opinion that the prosecution was able to establish appellants culpability for the death of ventura  
murder, that on or about the 1st day of september 1990 at about 700 in the evening more or less at barangay laguna greenhills municipality of san fernando province of cebu philippines    the abovenamed accused with deliberate intent and intent to kill by means of treachery and evident premeditation and taking advantage of nighttime did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and stab entellano gonesto with the use of a knife thereby inflicting upon the latter fatal wounds on his breast which caused his death shortly thereafterthe prosecutions story relies solely on herman tambacans eyewitness testimony which is succinctly summarized by the rtc as follows    on september 1 1990 at about 700 in the evening he  herman tambacan  was at his residence more particularly at the door of his house at green hills laguna san fernando cebu; that on that occasion he saw entellano gonesto the victim passed  sic  by his house and later he also saw eleuterio tampon who came out from  sic  the cotton tree and stabbed entellano gonesto that the cotton tree is more or less 6 meters away from his house;   ; that when the accused stabbed the victim the latter was hit on his left breast; that after the victim was stabbed he ran away with the weapon stuck at the portion where he was hit; that he could not tell what kind of instrument hit the victim whether it was a bolo a dagger a chisel but he only saw that it was a sharpbladed instrument; that said entellano gonesto was hit and ran away with the assailant chasing after him      ; that he was certain that there was only one  1  stab wound delivered to the victim    who was still able to run away for about 30 meters more or less from his  tambacans  house and that the victim fell not along the footpath but across the cornfield   ; that after he  the victim  was hit and ran fast he saw the victim fell  sic  down because of his injury with face to the ground;   ; that he was able to see eleuterio tampon pulled  sic  the weapon from the breast of entellano     while he was holding the weapon the accused went to him  herman tambacan  about 6 meters distance more or less;    he was confronted by the accused whether he was taking side with the victim and that he told the accused that he was a barangay tanod   ; that after that the accused ran away towards the direction of his house; that after informing the barangay captain  benigno marilao  he  tambacan  was brought to the municipal building of san fernando cebu and an investigation was made and the barangay captain and the police went to arrest eleuterio;   on the other hand appellant posits his own version of the facts in support of his allegation that he inflicted the fatal wound on entellano gonesto while acting in defense of himself in his testimony in open court he claimed the following on september 1 1990 at around 700 oclock in the evening he was on his way to the junction of magtalisay san fernando cebu to meet his son who was coming home from work in the city while on his way at a distance of about 100 meters from the house of herman tambacan he met entellano who immediately lunged at him with a   flamingo   knife he ran away but entellano was able to grab his left shoulder dragging him down in the process as his body was blocking the way entellano stumbled over him thereby losing grip of the   flamingo   appellant was able to grab the   flamingo   and thrust it to the chest of entellanohe then fled the scene of the crime bringing with him the   flamingo   which he eventually threw awaydefense witness william campugan who claimed to have witnessed the tragic incident on the night of september 1 1990 corroborated the testimony of the appellant he narrated that at around 700 oclock in the evening of the said date he and five  5  other persons were seated on a bench beside the road when a fight broke out between the appellant and entellano some twenty  20  to thirty  30  meters from where they were seated according to him it was entellano who started the fight as he was the one who pulled out a knife from his bag he saw both the appellant and entellano running in the direction of the farm they wrestled with each other until the appellant stood up while entellano was left lying on the ground appellant then proceeded home while witness william campugan and his companions went to the dance some 100 meters away to ask for assistance from the people therewilliam campugans testimony does more damage than good to the case of the defense first he claimed that the moon was not bright on the night of september 1 1990yet he proceeded to narrate in detail the fight between entellano and appellant which took place some 20 to 30 meters away he unhesitatingly pinpointed entellano as the assailant whom he saw rushing at the appellant with a knife while appellant himself claimed that as the   night was so dark   he could not immediately identify the assailant even up close furthermore considering that william campugan was the nephew of appellant it is inconceivable that he and his five  5  companions would merely watch the attack against his uncle and not even attempt to aid the latter his testimony is clearly contrary to human experience and is thus unbelievable bespeaking only of his bias as a relative of the appellant in the face of herman tambacans eyewitness account appellant miserably failed to prove selfdefense it is true that the cardinal principle in criminal law is that the burden of proving the guilt of the accused lies squarely on the shoulders of the prosecution conviction must rest not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the prosecutionhowever in cases where the accused admits committing the crime but invokes selfdefense to escape liability the rule is reversed and the onus probandi to prove the elements of his defense is on him he must prove clearly and convincingly the following  1  unlawful aggression on the part of the victim;  2  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and  3  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himselfthe initial crucial point of inquiry is whether there was unlawful aggression on the part of the victim for absent this essential element no claim of selfdefense can be successfully interposed if there is no unlawful aggression there is nothing to prevent or repel and the second requisite of selfdefense would have no basisunfortunately what is immediately apparent from the testimony of herman tambacan is the fact that the unlawful aggression was initiated not by the victim entellano but by the appellant himself as the absence of the first element suffices to override appellants claim of selfdefense further discussion of the other two elements is no longer necessary as a last ditch effort to exculpate himself from criminal liability appellant invokes the testimony of the medical expert dr jesus cerna to further assail the credibility of the prosecutions story dr cerna testified as follows fiscal fernan q there is a marking here with annotation   stab wound   please tell the court the exact location of this stab wound reflected in the sketch a the stab wound as indicated in the sketch is situated on the left side of the chest at the level of the 5th intercostal space or that space between the 4th or 5th or 6th rib fiscal fernan q in exhibit   c2   the bracketed portion there is a phrase which states   penetrating left thoracic cavity   please tell this court what does this mean   left thoracic cavity   a left thoracic cavity is that cavity of the chest which encloses the heart the lungs and pulmonary vessels q dr cerna when you were talking of heart the heart was damaged by the stab wound atty enriquez it is already testified that it was hit fiscal fernan q just to make it clear a yes it was hit q for the same reason that the lung was likewise hit a yes sir q now please tell the court in this particular case of the victim how long do you think did he die  sic  upon being hit  sic  this vital organ a well as a general rule sir injuries or wounds involving vital organs of the body like the heart the lungs the big blood vessels the liver and the stomach are immediately fatal although there are recorded cases that sometimes it  sic  will not prevent the victim from performing volitional movement for a while court q what do you mean by volitional movement a like for example walking or movements of the body your honor q and it also depend  sic  upon the physique or build of the person a yes your honor it will depend upon the resistance of the victim q when you viewed the cadaver was it in good physique a he was approximately 120 lbs but somewhat tall he was about 172 cms in length and about five six in height q he was of normal build a normal build court proceed fiscal fernan q with this kind of injuries  sic  sustained by the victim a few seconds thereafter could you tell the court if he can still talk doctor a well again wounds involving vital organs of the body like the heart the lungs and the liver as i said although as a general rule they are fatal immediately after the incident but there are cases in the past recorded that sometimes they could not prevent the victim from performing volitional movement like for example walking court q and you will also agree with the court that it will also depend upon the willpower of the victim himself and what kind of physique he has a it depends upon the organs involve  sic  your honor for example if the organs or the aparatus  sic  for speech is involved naturally it will prevent the victim from speaking or talking for example if the voice the trachea is involved it will prevent him from talking but sometimes although the trachea is not injured if there will be the presence of foreign bodies that will be lodged in the trachea like for example blood clots coming from the lungs of course this will incapacitate the victim from talking x x x x x x x x x atty enriquez q now you described the wound which is very serious perforating the heart and the liver and other organs there is testimony that the weapon used after being embedded in the body left chest of the victim was not pulled out and the victim was still able to run for about 30 to 50 meters from the place where he was stabbed is that possible doctor considering the nature of his wound court in other words from the place where he was stabbed the weapon embedded  sic  after the victim was killed atty enriquez q from where he fell which is about 25 meters according to the prosecution is that possible that he could still run a well actually your honor although as i said before wounds involving vital organs of the body are immediately fatal but it will not be impossible sometimes for a person to run for a short distance after he sustained the injury but for me 2530 meters considering that the auricle was involved the pulmonary vessel was also involved i think that is far quite very far that distance is too far for a victim sustaining that kind of wound to run q as a matter of fact the maximum distance which he could have run from the place where he received that wound to the place where he fell is more/less 3 to 5 meters distance is it not a well i would not say maximum but that distance of 25 meters considering the wound it is quite farit is also argued that the prosecutions story is further belied by the physical evidence more particularly the absence of traces of blood at the place where entellano was allegedly stabbed appellant cites the following pertinent testimony of dr jesus cerna atty enriquez q now you said that the cause of death was hemorrhage or  sic  secondary to stab wound considering that the heart was penetrated including the lungs and vital organs of the body naturally doctor the moment these organs were pierced an amount of big volume of blood will ooze out from his body is it not a yes sir that is true especially that in the injury or wound in the heart part of the heart that was penetrated was the auricle and considering that the auricle has a thinner wall than the ventricle so the loss of blood will be more massive because the auricle having a thin wall will easily permit the flow of the blood outside as compared with ventricle whose wall is thick q thus naturally that blood oozing from the body of the deceased will have to flow to the ground so that there will be traces of blood right on the spot where he was stabbed is it not a yes especially that there was a communication between the heart and the outside when the stab wound exist  sic  it follows that there will be blood coming out from the stab wound which fall to the ground q in other words to determine the place or location where the victim was stabbed we can determine by looking at the ground if there are traces of blood thereon a yes sir q if the place allegedly where the victim was stabbed had no traces of blood that must be an indication that he was not stabbed there is it not a well that is true sir as a matter of fact one of the legal importance of stabbing incident is to determine the place where the crime was committed because if the victim was killed on the very spot where his body is found there  sic  will be full of blood around his body as a matter of fact that is one way of determining whether the victim was salvaged in their place and was just placed or dumped in another place q considering the nature of wound and the vital organs involved as described by you doctor if the victim after being stabbed will run towards a distance about 20 to 30 feet  sic  naturally you can see traces of blood towards that direction is it not a yes sir because immediately after the infliction of the stab wound blood will ooze right away from the blood vessels and it will ooze from the stab wound easily especially that the length of the stab wound is quite big between five  5  cms atty enriquez q so in the absence of any blood stains on the ground which would show that the victim ran from one place to another that will negate the theory that the victim after being hit was still able to walk or run away for 20 to 30 meters but was really hit and stabbed on the place where there  sic  was full of blood on the ground is it not a pardon sir court q the victim was able to run or walk but he was killed in  sic  the spot atty enriquez that he was killed really in  sic  the spot not elsewhere because of the absence of blood in any other place a well the place where the body is found and within  sic  the body there was blood most probably that is the place where he was stabbed court when a person is stabbed and then he was able to ran  sic  away and was killed in some other place in the absence of blood where he was stabbed and the presence of blood where he was killed a well your honor it is shall we say common sense that when a person was stabbed in the very place where his body is found you can expect the place to be full of blood q but this is also a way of finding out where he was stabbed that the place where he was stabbed there are  sic  also blood a well because immediately after the infliction of the injury blood will come out from that wound naturally there will be some or little amount of blood that will be found especially your honor that the organs inflicted were the heart and the lungs q but in a case where from the place where he was stabbed there was blood and the place where he was killed there was blood what could you say about it a if the place where the alleged crime was committed there was blood and also the place where his body was found there was blood so the presumption is that the victim was able to walk from the place where he was stabbed to the place where he fell q could there be no possibility that in between the place there is no blood but in the place where he was stabbed there was blood and the place where he was killed there was blood a now i think in my honest opinion your honor it is very unlikely that in between the place where the crime was committed to the place where his body was found you cannot trace blood because bleeding there is profusex x x x x x x x x  
homicide, hereunder is the recital of facts of the case as summarized by the trial court and duly substantiated by the evidence on record piecing together the testimonial and material evidence submitted in these cases the court cannot but conceive the following resume that on the night of june 20 1990  sic  accused john jenn porras and sergio emelo went to the police station looking for pfc roldan emelo of the cavite city pnp a cousin of the latter and was directed by sgt pilapil to where he was; that they had some food and drinks at the banaue restaurant and emelo asked for his black ammo pouch and some 38 caliber ammunition; that thereafter perhaps in connivance with marcelo real of the philippine coast guard who was then moonlighting in his tricycle flagged him down along m gregorio st and in which marcos luciano was a passenger at the time and was told to alight as they were already overloaded and whereat luciano identified john jenn porras who was then wearing a maong jacket and maong pants when he was focused by the headlights of the incoming vehicle; that they proceeded to the aroma beer house where the victim rosendo mortel was tabled  sic  and wherein some misunderstanding happened and ronnie mortel went out and was shot at close range by either porras or emelo as seen by a waitress maribel herman who pointed to porras as the assailant and who after seeing rosendo mortel sprawled on the ground and bloodied fled into an alley and thereafter returned and shot the prostrate victim twice and sped away and who hailed sgt catalino bermas  sic  was then monitoring the situation as an intelligence operative on his motorcycle to give chase; that during the shooting jose malumay who was on a bicycle on his way home after going to a house near sangley point also heard a gun shot which he mistook for a blowout and when he offered to assist he saw two men one in dark attire and the other in white tshirt who from the information of the witnesses fixed their identities as the two accused john jenn porras and sergio emelo who fired the initial shot and ran away and later on returned to finish the job with porras allegedly having fired the last two shots killing the victim instantaneously as he was brought to the hospital dead on arrival during the chase given by catalino bermas he was shot by emelo along the way after having told them  emelo and real  to go to the police station and bermas feeling the effects of his wounds chanced upon cpl dela cruz in front of the 501 beer house and asked for his assistance and they rode in tandem and pursued the tricycle at the saulog terminal compound where only the tricycle was left together with the driver marcelo real who pointed to the two accused as the assailants sgt amorico alvarez who was then following up unsolved cases in the station was apprised of the shooting and went to the place and was informed about the identity  sic  of the tricycle which they traced to the house of real whereat they found the black ammo pouch and the camouflage holster with the name of emelo inscribed and with live and spent bullets on the back seat and putting together the evidence thus far gathered he was able to apprehend the three namely porras emelo and real now to dispose of the issues raised appellants claim that some of the trial courts factual findingsare product of imagination and gross misrepresentation allegedly due to lack of evidentiary support while our examination of the record shows that the assailed factual findings are in some respects inaccurate they however did not debilitate the prosecutions case and neither did they affect the appellants finding of guilt spo3 rolando villegas one of the prosecutions witnesses indeed positively identified the appellants as the persons who showed up at the cavite city police station at around 900 oclock in the evening of june 19 1990 looking for pfc roldan emelo  persons who the record reveals were responsible for the dastardly crimes thus x x x x x x x x x q while doing it mr witness while waiting for this report you have just mentioned can you tell the court if there was an incident which transpired in your office a because i have read my statement i remember that two men arrived at the police station asking for the whereabouts of pat roldan emelo q and this pat roldan emelo is connected with your office a yes maam q do you know this person who asked for roldan emelo a i came to know those persons when they were involved in a shooting incident in san antonio q at the time they came to you asking for roldan emelo could you still recall how they look like a yes maam because the suspects were identified by the witnesses one involved is a small man dark wearing white tshirt maong pants and carrying a black shoulder bag the other one is chubby and he is wearing a sleeveless cream tshirt carrying a maong jacket and wearing maong pants q if you will be able to see these persons again can you recall them a yes maam q kindly took around the court room and point them out a  witness pointing to emelo as the one carrying a shoulder bag and the other one who is chubby identified himself as john jenn porras  q you said these two persons came to you asking for roldan emelo what did you do a i pointed to the traffic division q and that is where roldan emelo was a yes maam q when the two men got your answer what did they do a they proceeded to the traffic division and a few moments later they went out emphasis supplied  next appellants impugn the credibility of the prosecution witnesses by citing the seeming inconsistency between the testimonies of maribel german who apparently saw one assailant and jose malumay who on the other hand claimed to have seen two assailants the following are excerpts of the questioned testimonies jose malumay x x x x x x x x x q what was this incident kindly relate to the honorable court a on that night from sangley going to rafael palma st and m gregorio st i passed by a tricycle upon reaching the corner of calpo i heard a shot which i presumed it  sic  was a tire which exploded so i stopped my bicycle because i thought they would need help when i stopped and look towards the tricycle i saw the man riding at the back seat of the driver alighted  sic  mam x x x x x x x x x q what happened to the man who used to sit at the back of the driver a when the man went to the side of the sidecar another man alighted from the sidecar mam q and then what happened when that man alighted from the sidecar a when the man went to the side of the sidecar another man alighted and  sic  jerked by the man coming from inside the sidecar x x x x x x x x x fiscal diesmos let us just say the man who alighted from the driver  sic  seat let us call him the second man and the man who alighted inside  sic  the tricycle as the first man court what did you see a when the first man jerked himself  sic  the second man went to the front of the tricycle sir fiscal diesmos q in what direction was the second man headed when he ran a he crossed the street going to capt jose st mam q what else happened when the second man ran towards capt jose st a i hear  sic  another shot then that second man fell on the ground mam q and then what else happened when that second man fell on the ground a the third man alighted from the sidecar when he alighted from the sidecar he is going  sic  towards the back going to the fallen man  referring to the second man  the third man went to the body of the fallen man which i thought he would help him but as i was about to go away i heard another shot then i saw a fire from the hands of that third man q when you saw that fire coming from the hands of the third man at this point in time where was the third man a beside the fallen man mam q and his hands was  sic  how would you describe how was the position as the fire was coming from his hand a his hand was positioned as if he was going to help the fallen man x x x x x x x x x q but mr witness since you saw the incident would you be able to tell the honorable court the attire of the third man who shot the second man a as far as i can remember the man who shot the second man was wearing a dark attire mam q what about the first man the man who alighted from the back of the driver of the tricycle did you see how he was attired a it seems he was wearing a white shirt because the upper portion of his attire was light mam maribel german q while you were at work at cathys refreshment do you recall of  sic  any unusual incident that happened a yes maam there was q what was this will you please tell the honorable court a i heard two gunshots q when you heard two gunshots what did you do a i looked where the gunshots came from q and you saw what did you see anything a there was q what did you see madam witness a a fallen man crawling on the ground q what else did you see if you saw anything else a and a man standing about to enter an alley q was that man able to enter the alley a yes maam q and what happened next after he enter  sic  the alley a and who again emerged therefrom q after emerging from the alley what did he do if he did anything a again he shot the crawling man two times q after shooting the man twice what did that man do next a he poked  sic  his gun in our direction so we went inside the cathys refreshment x x x x x x x x x q you said you went inside the restaurant when that man poked a gun at you is that right a yes maam q inside the restaurant what did you do a i peeped q where did you peep through the window a i peeped at the door q what did you see a i saw the man boarded  sic  a bicycle x x x x x x x x x q but were you able to notice how he was dressed his attire a he was wearing a tshirt and maong pants and rubber shoesa closer scrutiny of maribel germans testimony reveals that she merely saw an assailant shoot the victim  mortel  while sprawled on the ground but nowhere in her testimony did she state that there is only one assailant in fact maribel german never testified witnessing the crime from its inception which jose malumay witnessed to have been authored by two assailants this explains the apparent inconsistency between the witnesses testimonies at any rate the alleged inconsistency just discussed which was shown to be otherwise is neither substantial nor of such nature to cast a serious doubt on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses the established rule of evidence is that inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect either the substance of their declaration their veracity or the weight of their testimonyinconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses if only in minor details reinforce rather than weaken their credibility for it is usual that witnesses to a stirring event should see differently some details of a startling occurrence   discrepancies on minor details which do not destroy the substance of the witness testimony show that the witness was not rehearsedappellants defense of alibi must likewise fail against their positive identification alibi cannot prevail prosecution witness marcos luciano positively identified appellant john jenn porras as one of the persons who were on board the tricycle which was used as get away vehicle by mortels assailants just before midnight on june 19 1990;spo3 rolando villegas identified sergio emelo and john jenn porras as the persons who arrived at the pnp station looking for pfc roldan emelo at around 900 oclock on that evening of june 19 1990;maribel german described one of the assailants as wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes and was riding in a tricycle;and sgt catalino bermas confirmed the person described by maribel german to be sergio emelothe same person he identified as his assailant on that same nightfurthermore proof that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed is not enough appellants must likewise demonstrate that they could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or in its vicinity at the time of its commissionin this connection we quote with approval the trial courts observation the alibi set up by the two accused that they were in their barracks sleeping all the time up to early morning is of no moment as alibi is the weakest of all defenses specially  sic  so when the place where they alleged to have been at the time of the commission of the offense and the situs where the incident happened is  sic  not so far  sic  distant from each other and maybe  sic  reached within a reasonable time which in the instant cases are no more than 100 or 200 meters apartappellants also contend that the nonpresentation of cpl crisanto de la cruz one of the police officers who first investigated the crime and pfc roldan emelo the police officer who gave appellant sergio emelo the black ammo pouch bag and 38 caliber bullets is fatal to the prosecutions case we find this contention devoid of merit the matter of deciding whom to present as witness for the prosecution is not for the accused or for the trial court to decide as it is the prerogative of the prosecutor   moreover if the appellants believed that the testimony of the said police officers would bolster their theory then they could have availed of the compulsory process to have the latter produced as their witnesseswhich they failed to do so appellants likewise characterize as hearsay the testimony of sgt amorico alvarez on pfc roldan emelos statements to the police investigator implicating them to the crime this contention is bereft of legal basis for it is a settled rule that when a testimony is presented to establish not the truth but the tenor of a statement or the fact that such statement was made as in this case the same is not hearsay furthermore appellants conviction did not hinge solely on the assailed testimony as there were other evidence extant in the records establishing their guilt beyond reasonable doubt finally appellants argue that they were not positively identified in open court by the two prosecutions witnesses  german and malumay  to be the culprits hence they may not be convicted of the crime charged the argument is specious and erroneously assumes that there was no identification made while witnesses german and malumay did not point out the appellants in open court they nonetheless described the perpetrators attire at the time of the commission of the crime with one assailant wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes and the other assailant wearing a dark attire these descriptions conform with the other witnesses testimony identifying the appellants to be wearing the same attire during the commission of the crimes in any event it is a settled rule that there can be a conviction based on circumstantial evidence when the circumstances proved form an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion pinpointing the accused to the exclusion of all others as the perpetrator of the crimeas in this case in order that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to convict the same must comply with these essential requisites viz  a  there is more than one circumstance;  b  the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven;  c  the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubtthe record reveals that there were at least eleven circumstances correctly considered by the trial court in arriving at its judgment of conviction viz moments before the incident of june 20 1990 appellants were seen inside the cavite city pnp station looking for pfc roldan emelo;  2  appellant sergio emelo was then wearing a white tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes while appellant john jenn porras was wearing a sleeveless cream tshirt maong pants and was carrying a maong jacket 3  on the same evening just before the incident appellant john jenn porras then wearing a maong jacket was seen on board the tricycle of marcelo real together with a man wearing a white tshirt; 4  the two assailants were described by jose malumay as respectively wearing a dark attire and white tshirt 5  one of the persons who shot rosendo mortel was described by maribel german as wearing a tshirt maong pants and rubber shoes; 6  the assailants of rosendo mortel bearded a tricycle to flee from the scene of the crime 7  sergio emelo was identified by sgt catalino bermas as the person on board the tricycle that fled from the scene of the crime;  8  sergio emelo was identified by sgt catalino bermas as the person who shot him during the chase; 9  a magazine pouch camouflaged holster with the name emelo 38 caliber empty shells and live bullets were found immediately after the shooting on the floor of the tricycle used by the appellants;  10  rosendo mortel and sgt catalino bermas both sustained gunshot wounds from a 38 caliber handgun;and  11  the flight of the appellants which was not sufficiently explained there is no reason for us to disagree with the trial court on these matters these findings are fully supported by the evidence on record and constitute an unbroken chain of events which by their concordant combination and cumulative effect more than satisfy the requirements for the conviction of the appellantsthe trial court however erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery in criminal case no 24591 treachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itselfand to appreciate it two conditions must concur viz  a  the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate and  b  that said means of execution be deliberately and consciously adopted in this regard the prosecution failed to definitively establish the manner in which the initial assault against the deceased victim was committed to justify the appreciation of treachery this hiatus in the prosecutions evidence cannot be substituted by mere suppositions as what the trial court apparently did it is a well settled rule that in order to appreciate treachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression as in this case the same must be shown present at the inception of the attackabsent any showing therefor treachery as a qualifying circumstance may not be considered

homicide, the facts are set forth succinctly in the brief of the office of the solicitor general for the appellee dated april 6 1998 which we find duly supported by the records in the evening of may 8

answered that appellant bumped his head on the door because he came home intoxicated  ibid p 5  pantojan directed the same question to appellant later in the evening and the latter replied that he accidentally bumped his head on the side of the bed when he was about to sleep  id p 6  at the police station the following day may 10 1991 appellant was identified as the assailant by both getalla and nasibog the two witnesses later executed their individual statements narrating in detail the events that transpired that fateful night  record pp 45  appellant in his brief claimed that he was waylaid in the early evening of may 8 1991 by the seashore of barangay punta piape padada davao as a result of being waylaid and mauled he sustained injuries on his forehead said mauling incident was entered in the barangay blotter he later proceeded to the disco dance in the barangay hall of punta piape with his wife just after the brownout late in the evening he along with others heard shouts that someone had just been stabbed with his wife he proceeded to the house of his fatherinlaw after the incident in his testimony appellant stated that earlier he saw the victim around five meters by his own estimate from the store this led the trial court to accept the prosecutions evidence that there was indeed light coming from the stores surrounding the dance area sufficient for the prosecution witnesses to identify the victim in addition the trial court found that eyewitness getalla was only six meters away from appellant and the victim when the stabbing incident occurred the possibility of getalla misidentifying the assailant was remote getalla testified he had known appellant from the time getalla was ten years old given these circumstances getallas testimony is indeed reliable and credible as we have repeatedly held the testimony of a single witness if positive and credible is sufficient to support a conviction even in a charge of murder getalla also testified that he chased appellant until the latter bumped into a basketball court post hitting his forehead at this point nasibog another prosecution witness saw and recognized the appellant running very fast until he bumped into the post nasibog had no difficulty recognizing appellant as he and the latter are neighbors aside from the fact that nasibog was only one meter away from appellant at the time this double identification by getalla and nasibog of appellant at the scene of the crime removes any taint of doubt as to the presence of the appellant at the scene and his involvement in the crime noteworthy appellant did not point to any ill motive on the part of getalla and nasibog that could have prompted them to testify against him appellant himself testified that he considered both getalla and nasibog to be his friends where conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness did not appear to be biased against the accused their assertions as to the identity of the malefactors should normally be accepted in the absence of any evidence to show that the witness was actuated by any improper motive his identification of the accused as the assailant should be given full faith and credit but appellant argues that getallas testimony identifying him as the offender is contradicted by the entry in the police blotter that the victims assailant was an   unidentified person   but spo3 godofredo rosario witness for the defense testified that the blotter entry was based on information supplied by one inocencio sanchez who did not witness the killing the police blotter merely reflected what sanchez had told the police desk it did not necessarily mean that no one saw the stabbing of the victim nor that identification of the assailant would be foreclosed as a matter of judicial notice facts narrated in the police blotter are hardly conclusive though useful as leads appellant asserts that it took the prosecution witnesses considerable length of time to inform the police of the incident initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in criminal investigation however is common knowledge such initial reluctance is insufficient to affect credibility besides there was no delay in reporting the crime by other witnesses getalla disclosed what he had witnessed to a certain spo3 ricaplaza whom he met while he was on his way to the padada police station the morning after the stabbing incident police inspector angel pantojan testified that appellant was already a suspect and a subject for investigation in the morning of may 9 1991 spo3 godofredo rosario a defense witness also testified that spo3 ricaplaza had investigated the appellant these testimonies confirm that the appellant was investigated as early as the day following the perpetration of the crime prosecution witness nasibogs failure to immediately report the incident to the police does not diminish the value of his testimony what is significant is that he saw appellant fleeing from the scene of the crime at that time nasibog had still no direct knowledge of what had happened to the victim the wound on appellants forehead was sustained as a result of appellants bumping into a basketball court post while he was allegedly fleeing the scene of the crime according to the prosecution to the contrary appellant claimed he was wounded when he was waylaid at the seashore of barangay punta piape padada davao del sur early in the evening of may 8 1991 prior to the stabbing incident said mauling incident was reflected in the barangay blotter before the office of the punong barangay of punta piape padada however this statement regarding said wound was contradicted by appellant himself when he was investigated by police inspector angel pantojan according to pantojans testimony appellant told him that his forehead injuries where sustained when he bumped his head on the side of his bed further confusing the matter pantojan also testified that appellants wife said the wound was caused by appellants bumping his head on the door of their house later appellant and his wife both testified to rebut the testimony of pantojan they said that they had told pantojan otherwise that appellant had sustained his forehead wound as a result of being waylaid however they both testified that pantojan was a good neighbor of theirs and a person with whom they had no misunderstanding further prosecution witnesses romulado pantojan and noel rellon testified that when they saw appellant from a distance of one meter at around 800 oclock that evening of the fatal incident his face unmarked by any injuries or scars significantly ronnie nobleza a witness for the defense said that he saw no wound or scar on appellants face on the night of may 8 1991 all these testimonies cast grave doubts on the veracity of the claim of the defense that appellants wound was inflicted when he was waylaid earlier that day

the body  p 151 record  in her affidavit executed before the office of the city prosecutor marlyn asiado the commonlaw wife of the victim jose zaldy asiado named her first cousin romeo garcia as the assailant the information subsequently filed pertinently alleged that on or about the 3rd day of april 1988 in the city of legazpi philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the above named accused with intent to kill did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously and with treachery and evident premeditation attack assault and stab one jose zaldy asiado with a sharp bladed weapon thereby inflicting upon the latter injuries which directly caused his death contrary to law  p 2 rollo  no bail was recommended but the accused fled right after the incident he nonetheless was apprehended after 5 years and was thereupon arraigned whereupon he entered a plea of not guilty thereafter judge vladimir b brusola of branch 5 of the regional trial court of the fifth judicial region stationed at legazpi city found the accused guilty as charged and imposed on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua and the payment of p5000000 as indemnity for the death of the victim  p 41 rollo  the trial court arrived at its judgment of conviction by relying on the testimony of joseph ayhon and the victims mother angustia asiado the commonlaw wife of the victim marlyn garcia asiado begged to be excused as a witness for the prosecution via a hand written letter dated march 15 1994 on the ground that she just gave birth and only wanted peace of mind and happiness with her new husband and family joseph ayhon testifying in a categorical candid and spontaneous manner as maybe concluded from the finding of the trial court was able to establish that at 3 oclock on the morning of april 3 1988 he woke up early to perform his usual task of fetching water from the nearby   sagurong    spring  he had to pass by the mayon imperial hotels abandoned concrete water tank which was converted into the makeshift dwelling of the commonlaw spouses jose zaldy asiado and marlyn garcia he saw and met marlyn running and panicstricken and shouting for help because jose had been stabbed by romeo garcia ayhon further testified that because of curiosity he directly went to the water tank as he drew near he immediately sensed the thrusting sound of a knife and a male voice which repeatedly uttered   buhay ka pa buhay ka pa    you are still alive you are still alive  thereupon ayhon peeped through the makeshift door of the water tank and saw the face of accusedappellant illuminated through the gaping hole of the water tank accusedappellant was atop the still recumbent body of the deceased the other witness angustia asiado mother of the victim testified that on the early morning of april 3 1988 marlyn garcia arrived at the formers residence panicstricken and shouting for help because her  asiados  son had been stabbed by romeo garcia both immediately rushed back to the water tank but found jose zaldy already dead accusedappellant denied that he is romeo garcia he claimed to be romeo alcantara y gandol and that he did not know the victim jose zaldy asiado nor did he know his alleged first cousin marlyn garcia asiado the trial court correctly rejected this preposterous theory of the defense observing by this defense of the accused he actually means that romeo garcia is another person a different person from him that it was another person whom joseph ayhon saw on top of the victim that early morning of april 3 1988 that it was that other person romeo garcia who killed the victim and not him because he is romeo alcantara y gandol this denial of the accused cannot prevail over the positive identification of the witness joseph ayhon as the person whom he saw was on top of the victim more especially the testimony of angustia asiado that the accused is romeo garcia and not romeo alcantara y gandol because she knows the very person of the accused who claims to be romeo alcantara since childhood of the said accused the details of the testimony on the person and family of the accused is more than credible enough to inspire belief that the accused who claims to be romeo alcantara y gandol is one and the same person as romeo garcia angustia asiado knew the parents of the accused as felix alcantara garcia  father  and elena atun gandol  mother  because they resided at malangka legazpi city and at that time said spouses had their first child zenaida then the accused romeo garcia was born followed by miriam and the last was marlyn angustia asiado pointed to the accused during her testimony in the evidence in chief and at rebuttal as the very same romeo garcia who is the son of the spouses felix alcantara garcia and elena atun gandol and whom she knew since childhood the birth certificate  exh   d    secured by angustia asiado needs no further elucidation there is no other romeo garcia whose parents are named felix alcantara garcia and elena atun gandol than the romeo garcia she pointed to in court who gave the name of romeo alcantara the accused himself testified that his mothers name is elena atun gandol and that his fathers name is felix alcantara in an effort to avoid showing that his father could have been a garcia accused reasons out that he does not know the middle name of his father he also presented a brother of his mother a certain juan atun gandol who tried to cover up for the accused but whose testimony the court finds ridiculous and unbelievable and given to confuse the personality of the accused how can a brother such as the witness juan atun gandol not know the name of a sisters husband who just live for many years in a house five meters away from his house how can this witness not know the name of the father of the accused who is married to his sister and therefore his brotherinlaw when his brotherinlaw and the wife  his sister and mother of the accused  resided for many years beside the house of his parents where he lives the marriage contract of the accused and the birth certificate of his children showing his name as romeo alcantara without a middle name are not evidence of his own birth data and cannot be relied upon with respect to his personality and status of birth all said and done the court finds that the accused who in open court answers by the name of romeo alcantara y gandol is actually the accused romeo garcia whose real and complete name is romeo garcia y gandol and he is no doubt is the very person pointed to by the prosecution witnesses as the romeo garcia who killed jose zaldy asiado on april 3 1988 and that he assumed a different name thereafter to escape liability when the accused fled and left the place of incident to avoid being caught as he did succeed for five years only show that he is indeed guilty of the crime  pp 3940 rollo  accusedappellant zeroes in on the testimony of joseph ayhon the only eyewitness presented by the prosecution he contends that ayhons testimony is inconsistent improbable and extraordinary evidence; that ayhons unnatural reaction of placidly performing his usual task of fetching water after witnessing the stabbing incident without relating the startling incident to the barangay officials police authorities or his wife is allegedly out of the ordinary it is wellsettled that there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange startling or frightful experience  people vs raptus 198 scra 425 ;people vs lagota 194 scra 92  verily it is even preposterous to say that any one could exactly determine how a person will or should react to a given situation it has also been repeatedly pronounced that the failure to reveal at once the identity of the perpetrator of a felony does not affect much less impair the credibility of witnesses  people vs manlapat 196 scra 157  more so if such delay has been adequately explained  people vs manlapat 196 scra 157  in the case at bar joseph ayhon adequately explained why he did not report the incident he witnessed to the police authorities in this wise [on redirect examination] q ah    one last question your honor why did you not report what you have witnessed to the policemen a i did not report to the police because the victim has parents and wife  p 21 tsn august 17 1993  implying perhaps that he wanted to distance himself from the case or that at least the immediate relatives of the victim should be the ones to initiate any action such attitude is not nowadays unnatural or out of the ordinary verily it is not uncommon for a witness to a crime to show some reluctance about getting involved in a criminal case indeed the natural reticence of most people to get involved especially in a criminal case is now of judicial notice  people vs cortez 226 scra 91  the failure of the defense to attribute any ill motive on the part of ayhon to pin responsibility on accusedappellant adds more credence to ayhons testimony when there is no evidence to indicate that the principal witness for the prosecution was moved by improper motive the presumption is that such witness was not so moved and that his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit  people vs cabuang 217 scra 675  ayhons positive identification of accusedappellant as the perpetrator of the crime demolished the latters denial even standing alone such positive sole testimony is enough basis for conviction accusedappellant likewise posits the view that in matters relating to pedigree angustia asiado is allegedly disqualified to testify there is no merit to this contention as correctly argued by the office of the solicitor general the issue in this case is the identity of the accused not matters relating to his pedigree hence angustia asiados rebuttal testimony of her long acquaintance with accusedappellant and his family and that she knows accusedappellant to be romeo garcia and his parents to be felix alcantara garcia and elena gandol is loaded with probative value there is nothing objectionable in angustia asiados testimony that she had known accusedappellant since the latter was an infant if only to buttress the fact that the only   romeo   referred to by marlyn garcia is accusedappellant and no one else  pp 9899 rollo  accusedappellant likewise argued that no motive whatsoever has been shown or established or even insinuated by the prosecution that would drive him to commit so grave a wrong as killing a person this argument deserves scant consideration we have held so many times in the past that proof of motive is unnecessary where there is a clear and positive identification of the accused as in the case at bar accusedappellant insists that he is innocent his conduct after the incident however negates his pretension flight is an indicium of guilt  people vs javier 229 scra 638  such behavior cannot be anything but positive and convincing evidence of consciousness of guilt  people vs galit 230 scra 486  the trial court found the evidence considered altogether as adequate to prove accusedappellants guilt of the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt to wit the evidence for the prosecution clearly established that common law spouses jose zaldy asiado  the victim  and marlyn garcia asiado were asleep in their water tank dwelling when at about three oclock in the early morning of april 3 1988 accused romeo garcia surreptitiously entered through the makeshift door and successively stabbed to death jose zaldy asiado while the latter was lying down marlyn was shouting for help when she met joseph ayhon and told the latter that the accused romeo garcia stabbed her husband she also told angustia asiado  victims mother  that it was romeo garcia who stabbed her son this narration by marlyn asiado to joseph ayhon and to angustia asado that it was romeo garcia who stabbed jose zaldy asiado is admissible in evidence as part of the res gestae  section 36 rule 130 rules of court  to establish the identity of the assailant and of the circumstances of the stabbing as it was given immediately subsequent to the stabbing of said jose zaldy asiado joseph ayhon saw the accused romeo garcia while the latter was still on top of the victim the attack was made by the accused at the victims dwelling and in the early morning when it was still dark and considering the time of three oclock in the morning at the time when the victim was sleeping as he was in fact sleeping and helpless in case of attack dwelling was therefore aggravating because the crime was committed in the dwelling of the victim nighttime would also be aggravating because three oclock in the morning is dark and the accused purposely sought this time to avoid detection considering the testimony of the doctor that the stab wounds were inflicted with the accused on top of the victim who could either be sitting or lying down it is safe to conclude that the victim was sleeping when stabbed successively thereby helpless to repel any attack there were eleven  11  stab wounds on the different parts of the body of the victim others all these circumstances clearly prove that the crime committed was murder  pp 76 7778 rollo  accusedappellant had been charged with and convicted of the crime of murder for the killing of jose zaldy asiado article 248 of the revised penal code provides that to be liable for murder the accused must be proven to have committed the killing of another person under the attendant circumstances specified therein of these circumstances the information alleged treachery and evident premeditation to qualify the killing to murder facts it is unfortunate that the trial court failed to discuss the presence or absence of these qualifying circumstances however from the evidence on record treachery cannot be appreciated for treachery to be appreciated two  2  requisites must concur namely  1  that at the time of the attack the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and  2  that the offender consciously adopted the particular means method or form of attack employed by him  people vs estillore 141 scra 456  the mere fact that per the testimony of the doctor several stab wounds were inflicted with the assailant on top of the victim who was either sitting or lying down does not show treachery unless there is evidence that such form of attack was purposely adopted by the accused besides there is nothing in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses more particularly ayhon on how the assault began as the court held in people vs tiozon  198 scra 368  treachery cannot be considered when the witness did not see the commencement of the assault the importance of such testimony cannot be overemphasized considering that treachery cannot be presumed nor established from mere suppositions  people vs salvador 224 scra 819  the same degree of proof to dispel reasonable doubt is required before any conclusion maybe reached respecting the attendance of alevosia  people vs duero 136 scra 515  neither may evident premeditation be considered absent a clear showing of  1  the time when the offender determined to commit the crime;  2  an act manifestly indicating that the culprit had clung to its determination; and  3  sufficient time elapsed between the determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act  people vs briones 219 scra 134  the generic aggravating circumstances of dwelling although not alleged in the information may correctly be appreciated against the accusedappellant considering that it was fully established during the trial without objection on the part of the defense  people vs grefiel 215 scra 596 ;people vs lagario 224 scra 351  the trial court was however not correct in considering nighttime as an aggravating circumstance for nighttime to be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance there must be a convincing showing that the accused had purposely sought such period in order to facilitate the commission of the crime or to prevent its discovery or to evade the culprits capture  people vs rodriquez 193 scra 231  there is no proof at all much more a convincing one to warrant appreciation of nighttime as an aggravating circumstance

assailants ran towards poblacion west a tricycle with a certain rey suitos and a vic suitos on board followed them she was steadfast in her belief that the tricycle bearing rey and vic suitos was a

minutes later jovy pleaded with them to go after the escaping gunmen; however they returned emptyhanded vivian another daughter of jesus ylarde also witnessed the brutal killing according to her she

 2  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it;  3  and lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himselfunlawful aggression is an indispensable element whether in complete or incomplete selfdefensehe must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution for even if weak it could not be disbelieved after the accused admitted to the killingin this case the fact that accusedappellant sustained injuries did not signify that he was a victim of unlawful aggression his examining doctor testified that the wounds he incurred were merely superficial perhaps caused by a small bladed instrumentnot a bolo furthermore the medical certificate issued by dr carlota sandique of sto ni hospital makilala cotabato failed to indicate the purported injury of pantorilla on his upper breast and on his handrendering the testimony of accusedappellant pantorilla doubtful moreover his testimony was not corroborated by any witness neither his wife nor the wife of bartolome dahan who were allegedly inside the house when the stabbing incident occurred testified in court furthermore prosecution witness allan cablayan identified accusedappellant as the aggressor together with two other persons accusedappellant attempted to discredit the testimony of prosecution witness allan cablayan by alleging that he had been evicted from the house he was renting and had a grudge against accusedappellant for having initiated ejectment proceedings on behalf of the owner of the house however allan cablayan in his testimony denied bearing any grudge against accusedappellanthis testimony was given credence by the trial court which was in a better position to determine the issue of credibility of witnesses having heard the witness and observed his deportment and manner of testifying we find no cogent reason to rule otherwise absent certain facts of substance and value which may have been overlooked that might affect the result of the casefurther negating the claim of selfdefense is the manner in which the victim had been stabbed to death which does not show reasonable means to repel an aggression evidence shows that the victim franklin bello died from multiple stab wounds pictures taken at the scene of the crime reveal that the stomach of the deceased had been slashed and the intestines protruded there were also several bloodied marks on the head and other parts of the body of the deceased the nature location and number of wounds inflicted on the victim indicate a determined effort to kill himtherefore the plea of selfdefense cannot prosper in his second assigned error accusedappellant contends that the trial court convicted him on the basis of circumstantial evidence but failed to enumerate the circumstances supporting his conviction he points out that prosecution witness allan cablayan only testified that he saw the victim being dragged and locked inside his house then heard a voice inside crying for help and merely presumed that accusedappellant killed franklin bello the second assigned error is inconsistent with the first one accusedappellant in his testimony in court admitted that he took a knife from the floor and used it to stab franklin belloin invoking selfdefense accusedappellant admitted killing bello thus he can not now assert lack of proof to convict him therefore we find no error of the trial court in placing responsibility on accusedappellant jose m pantorilla for the death of franklin bello

murder, the prosecutions version of the facts which the lower court upheld is as follows one sabas constantino was stabbed in barrio santor sanchez mira cagayan on june 24 1963 sabas is closely related to the appellants being the brother of fausto and gregorio the nephew of marcelo and the cousin of hilarion the suspected assailant was inocencio romaguera who happened to be the brotherinlaw of the decedent carlino perdido inocencio romaguera fled after the stabbing and he still remains at large at about 10 oclock in the evening of june 27 1963 appellant marcelo went with a group to the house of the deceased looking for inocencio encarnacion perdido sister of the decedent who was in her house just 12 meters away heard marcelo threaten the decedent by saying first   if you are not going to bring out your brotherinlaw i will pierce you   and then   if you are going to involve yourself in this case you will be a victim   when these statements were made marcelo was at the foot of the stairs of encarnacions house and was about 21/2 meters away from her thereafter she talked with the decedent and confirmed that it was marcelo who uttered those remarks early the following morning june 28 1963 before taking breakfast the decedent left the house to see his plants and to gather vegetables in the field despite the admonitions of his wife florentina romaguera not to go out in view of the incident the night before when he did not return florentina went out to look for the decedent and failing to find him she reported his absence to barrio lieutenant ignacio de la cruz the latter in turn sought the aid of sanchez mira police chief damaso dumlao who sent policemen dominador valdez and tito mangligot to barrio santor to investigate the two policemen arrived in barrio santor late that evening and early the next day june 29 1963 they started looking for the decedent together with the barrio lieutenant quirino callo and other barriomates at around 10 oclock that morning they came upon the dead body of the decedent near the creek south of barrio santor the cadaver bore multiple stab wounds the post mortem examination  exhs m & m1  conducted by dr herman asanias that very morning showed the following wounds to wit  1  wound stab neck above medial third of clavicle left 11/4 inch long directed downward  2  wound stab neck left lateral 2 inches deep and 11/2 inch long  3  wound stab infrascapular region left 11/3 inch long  4  wound stab infrascapular region left below and medial to wound no 3 11/2 inch long  5  wound stab about 2 inches below wound no 4 11/3 inch

left posterior  16  wound contused thigh right middle third anterior dr asanias established the approximate time of death as of the morning of june 28 1963 and the cause thereof as severe hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds acting upon information linking the appellants to the death of the decedent the two policemen went to arrest them that afternoon and brought them to the municipal building for investigation returning to barrio santor to look for the possible weapons used valdez got from hilarions mother his bloodstained bolo  exh b  and a bloodstained shirt  exh c  mangligot on the other hand obtained from the house of gregorio a bloodstained bolo  exh f and a bloodstained calendar leaf  exh g  said appellants were pinpointed due to the presence of quirino callo and two young boys benjamin balicat age 12 and nonito salmazan age 13 who were all pasturing their carabaos in the fields near the scene of the killing the three gave sworn statements before the municipal mayor who conducted a preliminary examination on june 29 1963 in the absence of the municipal judge and on july 1 1963 they resubscribed their affidavits before the municipal judge balicat testified that in the early morning of june 28 1963 he saw the four appellants all armed with bolos following and then chasing the decedent towards the creek south of barrio santor shortly afterwards he again saw the four coming from the same direction and going homeward with hilarion fausto and gregorio holding blooddrenched bolos salmazan and callo declared that they saw the four appellants that morning coming from the same direction where on june 29 1963 the dead body of carlino perdido was found of the four only hilarion and fausto had their bolos unsheathed appellants impute to the trial court as first error its having relied upon the prosecution witnesses and in not upholding their allegedly credible defenses according to them what really happened was this fausto and his brother gregorio were in dugo cagayan from june 26 to june 28 1963 together with their father and brotherinlaw who brought sabas constantino to the camalaniugan emergency hospital for treatment marcelo was in his house in barrio santor the whole morning of june 28 1963 hilarion killed the decedent but only in selfdefense the defense of fausto gregorio and marcelo is therefore alibi but it is too well settled that alibi can not overcome the positive identification of the accused unless the prosecution witnesses are unreliable or unworthy of credence  which is primarily for the trial court to determine and the accuseds presence in some other place is clearly and convincingly established here the lower court gave much credence to the prosecution witnesses especially to the youthful balicat and salmazan we see no cogent reason to reverse it these two immediately gave their sworn declarationsto the authorities upon the discovery of the crime on june 29 1963 it would have been quite hard for them to concoct a falsehood within so short a time the records disclose that on july 31 1963 both made written declarations exhs  11 and 12  somewhat at variance with their previous affidavits however the lower court rejected these declarations on the finding that they were prepared under suspicious circumstances as evidenced by the fact that exh 11 bears thumbmark imprints whereas the affidavits found on pp 15 to 16 of the records bear the signature   benjamin balicat    exh p in addition we also note that exhs 11 and 12 were not sworn to and what is more although counsel for appellants had them all the while they were never presented to the two boys for explanation during the trialthe flaws and defects in the testimonies of the principal prosecution witnesses raised by appellants are too insubstantial to merit serious consideration the relationship of balicat callo and encarnacion perdido to the decedent does not necessarily vitiate their otherwise credible testimoniesbalicats presence near the scene of the crime on the morning of june 28 1963 is established not only by his testimony in court but also by his sworn affidavit and the statement  exh 11  taken by appellants counsel salmazans statement that balicat told him about the chasing of the decedent by the appellants is hearsay to prove the chasing but as balicat himself testified that he told the former about it that merely corroborates the fact that the two boys talked about the incidenthowever salmazan is himself an eyewitness to the fact that appellants came from the place where the dead body of the decedent was found appellants also cite a portion of the testimony of the decedents widow showing that it was stormy and rainy in the morning of june 28 1963 but they have conveniently omitted her succeeding statement denying that it was raining hard that morninglastly we can draw suspicious inference from the fact that quirino callo did not immediately denounce appellants before the authorities on june 28 1963 since he did not actually see them kill the victim but only saw them 300 meters away from the scene of the crime the alibi set up by appellants fausto and gregorio is not convincing although they claimed that in the reply morning of june 28 1963 they were still in dugo cagayan 70 kms away they have failed to prove that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crimeit was not impossible for them to have gone back to barrio santor on the evening of june 27 since they had nothing more to do in dugo assuming they really went there in fact two witnesses saw them in barrio santor that very evening  policeman mangligot while patrolling there and faustos own wife who said on direct examination that he slept at home on the night of june 27 1963 the only nonrelative who would corroborate the alibi of fausto and gregorio is francisco salvador who testified that in the morning of june 28 1963 he saw the two with their father ignacio in the motorboat while crossing the cagayan river this cannot overcome the positive identification made by the three prosecution witnesses who had no evil motive against the appellants salvadors testimony is comparatively weak since it does not appear that he conversed at all with fausto and gregorio moreover it is highly improbable that salvador could still remember ignacio constantino whom he met two years before while on a hectic campaign trail at night and for a very short time only marcelos uncorroborated alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the prosecution witnesses for stronger reasons since on the morning of june 28 he was at home in barrio santor not more than 2 kms away from the scene of the crime he was too near to altogether preclude his guilt hilarion admits having killed the decedent but insists that it was in selfdefense only according to him while attending a benefit dance in barrio santor sometime in june 1963 but the exact date of which he could not place he had an altercation with the decedent wherein he knocked down the latter the decedent then threatened to kill him and in the early morning of june 281963 while he was alone mending the gaps in their rice paddies the decedent came stabbed him suddenly hitting him below the right elbow and then chased him to the creek but there he was able to hold the decedents hand and then stabbed the latter successively on the left side this plea of selfdefense is belied and negatived however by a number of reasons first is the nature number and location of the decedents woundshilarions version cannot explain the three wounds at the back and the other wound in the neck  directed downwards  of the decedent the medico legal officer moreover stated that more than one weapon was used secondly the alleged bolo used by the decedent was not presented nor was its non presentation explained third hilarions silence and failure to immediately report to the authorities the alleged attack upon him by the decedent shows that he was not really innocent had he done so he could have easily shown to them the wound allegedly inflicted by the decedent which must still have been fresh by then he had ample opportunity to do so in the investigation conducted on june 30 1963 lastly the decedent had no motive to assault him for contrary to hilarions claim no benefit dance was held in barrio santor in the month of june 1963 as established by police chief damaso dumlao who keeps a record of all the permits therefor and barrio lieutenant de la cruz the supposed altercation between hilarion and the decedent thus appears to be a mere fabrication appellants next assail the imposition by the lower court of a uniform penalty for all of them in the absence of direct proof of conspiracy there were however sufficient facts and circumstances which impliedly showed conspiracy in this connection we deem it sufficient to quote from the decision of the trial judge as a whole the circumstances that the accused with bolos chased carlino perdido that afterwards they returned walking with hilarion constantino and fausto constantino holding their bolos with bloodstains while marcelo and gregorio constantino had their bolos tucked at their waists; that the body of carlino perdido was found later on in the place where these accused came from; that the bolos exhibits b and f with bloodstains were found in the homes of hilarion and gregorio constantino respectively; that marcelo constantino made the threats on the night of june 27 1963 to carlino perdido and that the calendar sheet exhibit g with bloodstains was found in the house of gregorio constantino all these point conclusively to the participation of the accused in the death of carlino perdido and show their guilt beyond reasonable doubt the motive on the part of the accused to kill carlino perdido is because they wanted to avenge on carlino perdido the death of their kin sabas constantino who was allegedly killed by inocencio romaguera a brotherinlaw of carlino perdido they suspected that the disappearance of inocencio romaguera was made so by carlino perdido thus marcelo constantino threatened carlino perdido to produce the body of inocencio romaguera otherwise he would be liquidated the last error alleged is the failure of the lower court to appreciate certain mitigating circumstances in favor of appellants again we see no error incomplete selfdefense and unlawful provocation by the decedent can not be considered in hilarions favor since his version of the decedents aggression is pure fabrication there is neither passion and obfuscation nor proximate vindication of a grave offense since the killing of the decedent was four days after the stabbing of appellants kin moreover it is doubtful if vengeance can be considered as a lawful sentiment

and after the firing had ceased she went out and hurriedly proceeded to her home in front of the store of honoria atienza she saw her husband sprawled on the ground full of blood she was not able to come close to him because somebody held her back a jeep arrived where her husband was placed but not long thereafter he was brought back already dead dr honorato navarro municipal health officer of bamban tarlac made the autopsy of the victims cadaver or the same night of the murder and per his necropsy reportthe victim cited of   hemorrhage massive secondary to gunshot wounds multiple  23  in neck chest and back lumbar region and upper and lower extremities   many of which were mortal wounds hitting vital organs in the neck such as the carotid artery and the vagus nerve both lungs and the liver kidneys and intestines in the lumber region the trial court rejected the accuseds testimony at the trial that he did not fire any shot at the victim but merely stood guard outside the store and that his role after salonga had ceased firing at the victim was to fire three shots in the air as a signal for them to depart thus    t he court entertains a very serious doubt on the veracity of the abovementioned statement of the accused because the same is contrary to what he stated when he was first investigated by the pc after his apprehension portion of his written statement  exh f1  reads as follows 12 t  natupad ba naman ninyo ang iniutos ni comdr francisco ronquillo na patayin si bienvenido laxamana s  opo napatay namin sa pamamagitan ng pagbaril sa kanya nuong gabing iyon ng ika30 ng marzo 1961 13 t  anong clase ng baril ang inyong ginamit sa pagpatay kay laxamana s  pareho po kaming gumamit ng pistola calibre 45 si mario salonga alias manding na aking kasama ay nakapagpaputok ng humigit kumulang sa labingdalawa at ako naman ay tatlong putok 14 t  sinabi mong natupad ninyo ang utos ni comdr francisco ronquillo alias commander manly na patayin si bienvenido laxamana natatandaan mo ba kung saan lugar ninyo binaril at pinatay ang taong naturan s  duon po sa loob ng isang tindahan sa poblacion bamban tarlac na ang mayari sa naturang tindahan ay hindi ko kilala the answer of the accused to the abovequoted question no 13 to the effect that he and salonga both used 45 caliber pistols in killing laxamana with salonga firing twelve shots and he three shots conveys no other idea than that the three shots he fired were directed at the victim and not upwards into the air the court is inclined to believe that this statement is the one in keeping with the truth taking into consideration the determination of the accused to participate in the killing of laxamana and the number of gunshot wounds found on the latters body at any rate the trial court further held there was no doubt as to the existence of conspiracy between the accused and salonga as the accused actively participated in the criminal design of salonga and acted in concert with him granting arguendo that the accused merely stood guard for salonga and that salonga alone inflicted the 23 gunshot wounds on the victim the trial court likewise rejected the accuseds contention that he should be punished only for the crime of rebellion as the murder was in pursuance of the huks rebellion movement since the motive for the killing of the victim was personal to avenge the alleged killing of a relative of commander manly and the alleged maltreatment of the father of salonga supposedly ordered by the victim the trial court further pointed out that while the victim had been an officer of the civilian guards in bamban that was more than ten years ago in 1950 and the victim was an ordinary civilian when he was shot in cold blood  
parricide, the lower court in the appealed judgment relied principally on the testimony of an eyewitness dionisia malasarteshe declared on the witness stand that on september 1 1960 at about 400 oclock in the afternoon the deceased ricardo manos left a bolo and two bamboo tubes in her sarisari store located in alegria lopez jaena misamis occidental at about 600 that evening of the same day he returned to the store this time accompanied by appellant he informed the witness then upstairs that he came back to get the things he left with her she went down so that she could give them back to him it was then that she heard him tell the appellant that it was time to go home as it was already night and his grandson a child of the appellant would be looking for him apparently appellant misconstrued the remark and asked his father whether he resented the fact that he was taking care of such child ricardo manos took care to explain that such was not the case for otherwise the child might not have lived till then appellant implied that the father was in a bad mood precisely because of the trouble occasioned by the rearing of the grandson at this juncture he pushed aside his father who fell down face upward it was then that appellant dealt the blows with his bolo that proved fatal the victim was hit first in the stomach and then in the breast dionisia malasarte rushed to appellant held him by the waist and pulled him away reproving him for his act he was told to stop but the advice came too late as the victim was already dead she then shouted for help a man came on the scene but the deed as above noted had been consummated she then sent for the authorities the chief of police coming that evening the following morning the judge of that municipality a doctor and a sanitary inspector came it was an entirely different story testified to by the accused santiago manos who pleaded selfdefense he would ascribe the antecedents of the tragic incident to his leaving a brotherhood association in which and his deceased father were members evidently such an act displeased the latter he was berated for his resignation which in the view of the father according to the appellant was a foolish thing to do sensing that he was under the influence of alcohol and was thus in an ugly mood appellant tried to pacify the deceased but his efforts were unsuccessful then so he would impress on the court his father rushed at him he tried to pacify the latter by saying that he was not going to fight in view of their relationship his father according to him was not appeased feeling that he was about to be killed and that he had to defend himself his father having unsheathed his own bolo he was fortunate enough to be able to pin both of his fathers hands against his stomachthen he proceeded   he struggled and he was able to free himself he blocked me again and pinned me holding in that position  i still asked him and told him i do not want to fight him because he is my father  after telling me i have no son santiago he again attempted to unsheath his bolo and fortunately i was able to pin his both hands on his belly  but he was able to extricate himself and then he held my hand and attempted to draw out his bolo and still i was able to pin his hand and continued pleading that i do not like to fight him inasmuch as i am the son and he is my father at this moment he insisted on the fight and inasmuch as he was able to move and was able to unsheath his bolo i parried it  and pinned both of his hands i drew my bolo and placed it in front of me just with the intention to avoid his onrushing actions to kill me  he continued his efforts to pacify his father and according to him it was then that the deceased   rushed at me which made the bolo to penetrate to his stomach  as to how the other wound was inflicted this was his version   i did not make any attempt to lunge at him it was my fathers unexpected onrushing towards me that made the bolo penetrate  his breast  from the above testimony it becomes easy to understand why the lower court failed to believe appellants story it does tax ones credulity an impartial party even if sympathetic to the plight in which appellant found himself would find it difficult to give a nod of approval to such a narration it might be said of course that the act imputed to the appellant that of killing his own father is one that is so shocking that there must have been an impelling motive from the testimony of appellant himself as well as that of his mother it turned out that the deceased was not a model family man he was drunk very often and on such occasions his wife the mother of the appellant was maltreated at such times he did not limit himself to using his fists but would even employ his bolo thus causing wounds to be inflicted on his wife the bitterness arising from such display of cruelty must have built up through the years in appellants heart as from his testimony he did hold his mother in the highest affection that incident that afternoon when he felt that he was being berated by his father must have brought to the surface the seething and smoldering feeling of resentment deep within him  
parricide, that on or about 900 am of may 1 1992 at brgy namantao daraga albay philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with intent to kill and while

accused fe arcilla y cornejo and the victim antonio arcilla were married in goa camarines sur on april 19 1975they had five  5  children accused was a teacher while antonio was an employee of national power corporation in daraga albay in 1983 she left her family to work in singapore her children remained in their conjugal home in camarines sur antonio on the other hand stayed most of the time in albay unknown to the accused antonio developed an illicit affair with lilia lipio the house of lilias parents in barangay namantao daraga albay served as their lovenest antonio sired two  2  children during his amorous union with lilia eventually the accused learned of her husbands infidelity she returned to the country in 1988 but her return did not stop the illicit relationship between lilia and antonio the illicit relationship came to a tragic end on may 1 1992 at about 900 am of said date accused went to lilias residence in namantao daraga albay looking for antonio it was the barangays feast day and lilias family had a lot of guests the accused found antonio having a drinking spree with his friends in a kiosk just a few meters away from lilias house the meeting immediately started to be violent accused approached antonio and slapped him she then went inside lilias house and instructed antonio to tell lilia to join them the three proceeded to the bedroom where the three  3  yearold son of lilia and antonio was sleeping a heated altercation between accused and antonio followed lilia left the bedroom and sat on a sofa in the receiving room the sofa was about two  2  meters away and she could see the bickering couple through the bedrooms door which was then halfclosed at the height of their arguments the accused took a fan knife from her shoulder bag and stabbed antonio on the chest causing him to embrace her tightly lilia barged back to the room held antonios belt at the back and pulled him away from accused accused was able to pull out the knife from antonios chest and she delivered a second thrust to antonio she hit him on the left thigh accused then fled with the fan knife blood stained her clothes antonio was rushed to the hospital where he died due to   hypovolemic shock due to massive hemorrhage secondary to stab wound   accused gave a different version she testified that she received an urgent letter from her eldest daughter asking for money to pay her tuition fees thus in the early morning of may 1 1992 she went to see her husband in his office in daraga albay the security guard told her that antonio was in namantao she proceeded to lilias residence and found antonio drinking with some friends antonio advised her up go home and not to make a scene irked she slapped him and then went inside lilias house antonio followed her up the bedroom where the threeyear old son of lilia was sleeping lilia joined the couple in the bedroom accused then asked them if the child was theirs lilia denied the accusation but antonio boldly admitted that the boy was theirs the admission provoked a heated verbal exchange between the accused and antonio while lilia brought the child outside the bedroom the altercation became violent when antonio pushed the accused and she hit the concrete wall and felt dizzy seeing a fan knife in a cabinet she held it with her right hand and warned antonio not to go near her or she would stab him antonio did not heed her warning they grappled for the knife until antonio was able to twist her left arm at her back she managed to free her left arm and held the knife with both hands however antonio moved behind her wrapped his arms around her held her hands and tried to force the knife towards her she twisted her body and the knife struck antonios left thigh undaunted antonio tried to direct the knife towards her a second time she bit his arm but his grip even tightened again she twisted her body and in the process the knife struck antonio when his embrace loosened she ran away she chanced upon a barangay tanod who helped her surrender to the barangay captain of namantao she was then taken to the police headquarters in daraga albay from the records of branch i of the regional trial court prosecutor de joya only attended the pretrial of the case the pretrial was however waived by the defense it appears that prosecutor de joya after the pretrial went back to branch 2 as in fact he crossexamined a witness for the defense in people vs rogelio andez this case was heard after the hearing in instant case so prosecutor de joya was absent for only a few minutes he was not absent for all the time that lilia lipio took the witness stand the presiding judge had a chance to talk to prosecutor de joya according to him he stayed at branch i for not more than five  5  minutes then returned to branch 2 when he returned to branch 2 the private prosecutor was still conducting his direct examination on lilia  emphasis supplied  the fleeting absence of fiscal de joya is not a sufficient ground to invalidate the testimony of lilia lipio as urged by appellant to begin with appellant herself did not object to the continuation of the testimony of lipio despite the momentary absence of the prosecutor appellant has not also shown any prejudice caused to her by the incident through counsel she was able to fully crossexamine lipio and test her credibility to be sure appellant misappreciates the reason requiring the public prosecutor to be present in the trial of criminal cases a crime is an offense against the state and hence is prosecuted in the name of the people of the philippinesfor this reason section 5 of rule 110 provides that   all criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal      only private crimes like adultery concubinage seduction abduction rape or acts of lasciviousness can be prosecuted at the instance of the offended partythe presence of a public prosecutor in the trial of criminal cases is necessary to protect vital state interests at stake in the prosecution of crimes fore most of which is its interest to vindicate the rule of law the bedrock of peace of the people as the representative of the state the public prosecutor has the right and the duty to take all steps to protect the rights of the people in the trial of an accused it ought to be self evident that the right belongs to the public prosecutor and not to the accused the absence of a prosecutor cannot therefore be raised by an accused to invalidate the testimony of a state witness if he cannot prove personal prejudice as in the case at bar in her second assignment of error appellant assails the credibility of lilia lipio the records will show that lilia lipio was clear and categorical when she testified on how antonio was stabbed by accused she declaredatty ninofranco what happened when you entered the room  lilia lipio  after i entered the room fe arcilla

chest and back  with powder burns on the right posterior chest; abdomen  gunshot wound on the right upper quadrant measuring 05 cm in diameter  point of entry  with multiple powder burns around the wound and on the right lumbar area  point of exit  gunshot wound on the suprapubic area  point of entry ; extremeties  with gunshot wounds on the right thigh upper third anterior aspect measuring 05 cm in diameter with powder burns  point of entry  and right buttocks measuring 05 cm in diameter  point of exit ; gunshot wound on the right thigh upper third posterolateral aspect; cause of death  multiple gunshot woundsdr omandac concluded that the shots were fired at close range perhaps within twentyfour  24  inches judging from the powder burns found around some of the wounds in the body of the victimand that the wound in the head which caused the victims instantaneous death was inflicted while   the victim was in a lying position  accusedappellant and the other police officers involved originally set out to perform a legal duty to render police assistance and restore peace and order at mundog subdivision where the victim was then running amuck there were two  2  stages of the incident at mundog subdivision during the first stage the victim threatened the safety of the police officers by menacingly advancing towards them notwithstanding accusedappellants previous warning shot and verbal admonition to the victim to lay down his weapon or he would be shot as a police officer it is to be expected that accusedappellant would stand his ground up to that point his decision to respond with a barrage of gunfire to halt the victims further advance was justified under the circumstances after all a police officer is not required to afford the victim the opportunity to fight back neither is he expected  when hard pressed and in the heat of such an encounter at close quarters  to pause for a long moment and reflect coolly at his peril or to wait after each blow to determine the effects thereof however while accusedappellant is to be commended for promptly responding to the call of duty when he stopped the victim from his potentially violent conduct and aggressive behavior he cannot be exonerated from overdoing his duty during the second stage of the incident  when he fatally shot the victim in the head perhaps in his desire to take no chances even after the latter slumped to the ground due to multiple gunshot wounds sustained while charging at the police officers sound discretion and restraint dictated that accusedappellant a veteran policemanshould have ceased firing at the victim the moment he saw the latter fall to the ground the victim at that point no longer posed a threat and was already incapable of mounting an aggression against the police officers shooting him in the head was obviously unnecessary as succinctly observed by the trial court  once he saw the victim he fired a warning shot then shot the victim hitting him on the different parts of the body causing him to fall to the ground and in that position the accused shot the victim again hitting the back portion of the victims head causing the brain to scatter on the ground x x x x the victim buenaventura wapili was already on the ground therefore there was no necessity for the accused to pump another shot on the back portion of the victims head it cannot therefore be said that the fatal wound in the head of the victim was a necessary consequence of accusedappellants due performance of a duty or the lawful exercise of a right or office likewise the evidence at hand does not favor his claim of selfdefense the elements in order for selfdefense to be appreciated are  a  unlawful aggression on the part of the person injured or killed by the accused;  b  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and  c  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himselfthe presence of unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non there can be no selfdefense complete or incomplete unless the victim has committed an unlawful aggression against the person defending himselfin the present case the records show that the victim was lying in a prone position on the ground  bleeding from the bullet wounds he sustained and possibly unconscious  when accusedappellant shot him in the head the aggression that was initially begun by the victim already ceased when accusedappellant attacked him from that moment there was no longer any danger to his life this court disagrees with the conclusion of the court a quo that the killing of wapili by accusedappellant was attended by treachery on the contrary the victim could not have been taken by surprise as he was given more than sufficient warning by accusedappellant before he was shot ie accusedappellant fired a warning shot in the air and specifically ordered him to lower his weapons or he would be shot the killing of wapili was not sought on purpose accusedappellant went to the scene in pursuance of his official duty as a police officer after having been summoned for assistance the situation that the victim at the time accusedappellant shot him in the head was prostrate on the ground is of no moment when considering the presence of treachery the decision to kill was made in an instant and the victims helpless position was merely incidental to his having been previously shot by accusedappellant in the performance of his official duty

and that while he was there he helped his cousin in her canteen on july 13 1993 he did not leave bagong silang and he worked in the canteen until 1000 oclock in the evening he later learned that he was implicated in the crime charged when he returned to his house in barrio libis kaloocan citytoto claimed that he and the victim nicanor doctolero who was his   bilas   were best of friends however he did not have harmonious relations with the family of his wife nancy dolosa for the reason that according to them he was jobless on the other hand the appellant interposed the defense of alibi he claimed that he was helping his cousin sina in her canteen in bagong silang kaloocan city on the date and time when the incident happened on july 13 1993 at 930 oclock in the evening his uncorroborated defense of alibi cannot be given credence in view of the positive identification by corazon that he was the attacker of her husband nicanor in addition corazon seriously disputed the claim of the appellant that the victim was his friend and that the  appellant  regarded nicanor as his own relative corazon claimed that the appellant was deeply envious of her husband who was wellliked by her family she disclosed in court that the appellant attempted to stab her husband less than two  2  weeks before the incident on july 13 1993 the prosecution presented in evidence the entry in the barangay blotter of barrio libis kalookan city reflecting the complaint of the victim nicanor doctolero to the barangay authorities for the earlier attempt on his life by the appellant henry flores alias toto on july 4 1993 at about 830 oclock in the evening in effect the said entry in the barangay blotter also belied the claim of the appellant that he had been staying with his cousin in bagong silang kaloocan city two  2  weeks before nicanor was stabbed on july 13 1993 a perusal of the post mortem report prepared by dr ludivino j lagat md shows that the victim sustained one  1  stab wound at the back on the left side of his body it is not clear however how the said stab wound was inflicted by the appellant on the victim the evidence of the prosecution merely shows that nicanor asked for a knife from his wife corazon who was then inside their store inasmuch as he  victim  was stabbed by the appellant when corazon looked out of the store window she saw the appellant already embracing the victim from behind and was attempting to strike another blow the victim parried the second blow and kicked the appellant which caused the latter to run hence treachery cannot be appreciated due to the failure of the prosecution to establish the manner by which the appellant inflicted the stab wound on the victim

homicide, that on or about the 16th day of february 1993 at around 300 oclock am at sitio dumeguiay barangay caupasan municipality of danglas province of abra philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the said accused with intent to kill with treachery and evident premeditation while armed with a sharppointed bolo  recovered  did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and stab one digna guillermo hitting her on the different parts of her body thereby causing her instantaneous death to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the offended party  p 6 rollo  the present review involves the issue of whether or not the facts as borne out by the record will justify the conviction of accusedappellant for the death of digna guillermo and if so what particular crime he may be held accountable for briefly the bare facts of the case are the following accusedappellant and the victim were commonlaw husband and wife with six children accusedappellant is a native of danglas abra while the victim of narvacan ilocos sur sometime in february 1993 accusedappellant tried to persuade the mother of the victim to sell her house and lot the proceeds of which he intended to borrow in order to bail out his son by another woman then charged with frustrated murder of homicide and detained at the provincial jail the victims mother did not agree to sell the house and lot  thereafter accusedappellant left for danglas abra for the town fiesta the victim together with three of their children followed him and stayed at the house of accusedappellants cousin virgilio alcartado at about 3 oclock on the morning of february 16 1993 virgilio was awakened by the victims cries for help he immediately went to the room of the couple and there saw accusedappellant in the act of stabbing the victim with a bolo virgilio tried to stop accusedappellant but to no avail finally when accusedappellant stopped his deadly assault virgilio succeeded in wresting the bolo soon thereafter the police authorities arrived at the crime scene and arrested accusedappellant in the meanwhile the victim was rushed to the la paz district hospital where she was declared dead on arrival the autopsy report  exhibit   a    indicated the following injuries sustained by the victim external #1 stab wound 25 cm penetrating 5th ics rright parasternal line #2 stab wound 25 cm penetrating 7th ics lleft parasternal line #3 stab wound 25 cm nonpenetrating  semilunar  wound at areola 4th ics l midclavicular line #4 stab wound 253 cm with intestinal

7th 8th rib  left were transected lungs r middle lobe was macerated and collapsed liver l lobe of the liver was macerated heart  normal intestines omentum and ileum  proximal 1/3  were perforated cause of death cardio resp arrest secondary to hypovolemic shock 2 to multiple stab wound  p 6 record  in the instant appeal accusedappellant assails the credibility of prosecution witness virgilio alcartado claiming that his testimony does not deserve credence as he nurtured illfeelings towards accusedappellant and wanted him out of the way according to accusedappellant virgilio used to collect the gsis pension of accusedappellants father and it was a financial blow to virgilio when accusedappellant decide to transfer the pensioners forwarding address from danglas abra to narvacan ilocos sur he also claims that witness virgilios credibility is crippled by his behavior at the scene of the crime considering that virgilio was the one whoa was nervous and jittery while the accusedappellant was calm and silent accusedappellant further contends that since virgilios testimony is not entitled to full credence the prosecution should have presented corroborative testimony that of accusedappellants two children who had also witnessed the events that transpired nonpresentation of the other eyewitnesses according to accusedappellant is nothing but suppression of evidence it is significant to note that the trial judge who personally observed the deportment of virgilio gave full faith and credence to his eyewitness account upon careful review of the record we find no cogent reason to rule otherwise the alleged transfer of the forwarding address of accusedappellants fathers gsis pension from danglas abra to narvacan ilocos sur cannot possibly constitute sufficient motive for virgilio to falsely testify against accusedappellant for a crime which he may not have committed specially so when the crime charged is of such gravity such as murder which may result in incarceration for life accusedappellant fails to show how virgilio cannot be so financially strapped as to falsely testify against accusedappellant his own cousin we likewise find nothing strange in the alleged nervous behavior of virgilio after witnessing the crime which may render his eyewitness account unworthy of any credence on the contrary such nervous deportment even bolsters his credibility because there is no behavior more natural and expected under a situation where one person is facetoface with a killer who is armed with sharp bolo than to be nervous and jittery it would have been more unnatural if it were otherwise furthermore what is really material and relevant in gauging the credibility of a witness is not his alleged behavior at the court by another witness but his demeanor on the witness stand when he recounts the sequence of events that he witnessed and which behavior is personally observed by the presiding judge himself this explains why as between an appellate court which is necessarily limited to the substance of the witnesses responses as appearing in the transcript of stenographic notes containing the record of the testimony of the witnesses presented during the trial and the lower court whose presiding judge had personally observed the demeanor of the witnesses consisting not only of their testimony but also their gestures facials expressions and their overall composure or lack of it on the witness stand the trial judge is by far in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses

killing of the deceased aileen testified that the three men – raelito eddie and larry – took turns in hitting the deceased edwin with pieces of wood aileen had no trouble identifying the three accused since her father edwin was carrying a lighted torch at the time he was assaulted although the torch fell to the ground when the deceased was hit by the three accused the torch continued to burn providing adequate illumination for the child to identify her fathers assailants accusedappellants nevertheless insist that aileen failed to identify them during the police line up since at the time she was asked to identify the assailants she pointed to all the men in the police line up as the perpetrators of the crime accusedappellants contention is corroborated by the witness elpidio tranilla who said that when aileen was asked to identify her fathers assailants she pointed to all the six  6  men in the line up when asked to do the identification for the second time aileen again pointed to all the six  6  menaccusedappellants allegation however is belied by the following testimony of po2 sereno dencing q now let talk about the police lineup you said that the suspect in the line up you

parricide, the information against appellant dated august 15 1989 reads as follows that at around 100 oclock in the morning of august 6 1989 at barangay don andres soriano toledo city philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused armed with a firearm and with intent to kill did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously shoot juanita suelto to whom he has been legally married thereby hitting and wounding her at her head at the left occipital region resulting in her death secondary thereto contrary to law as gleaned from testimonies on record the pertinent facts are as follows on august 5 1989 accusedappellant arrived home from his work at atlas consolidated mining corporation das toledo city it was the birthday of his wife juanita suelto who was feeling low that day since there was no money for a celebration the spouses were later overheard by the neighbors arguing then past 1200 midnight a gunshot rang from the spouses bedroom according to prosecution witness emiliana barluado who lived ten  10  meters away from the sueltos at around 100 am of august 6 1989 appellant knocked at her door shouting for her to fetch an ambulance because   juaning  sic  meet an accident   she hurriedly ran out of the house and with her neighbor juanita carcido rushed for an ambulance but none was available when they returned to the house of the sueltos the victim had already been brought to the hospital barluado also testified that on previous occasions the victim had confided to her that appellant and the victim often had quarrels and that at times during these quarrels the appellant would poke a gun at her and threaten to shoot her another witness juanita carcido who lived on the ground floor just below the quarters of the sueltos corroborated the story of barluado she narrated that she heard the appellant shouting at her neighbor barluado to fetch an ambulance and the appellant saying   i shot juanita   carcido testified that at one point during the commotion she observed the appellant washing his bloodied hands nbi forensics expert cesar cagalawan testified that when he examined both hands of the appellant they proved positive for nitrate however witness cagalawan did not discount the possibility that another persons hands trying to take away the gun from the hand of the victim could have fired the gun and thus be positive for nitrate burns below is his testimony on this point q you were positive in your findings both left and right hands of the presence of nitrate or powder burns a both left and right hands gave positive for nitrate q you cannot tell to this honorable court whether what hand was used by the accused in allegedly firing the firearm a it is possible left hand or right or both hands were used q mr cagalawan what is the radius within which the body of the person positive of nitrate when the firearm was fired a we cannot really tell the exact distance it is possible it is positive of the presence of nitrate his hands were near the firearm during the firing q not necessarily this hand fired the firearm just the same a still positive for nitrate q at the distance of one foot could it be possible that the same result even the subject did not hand the firearm a it is possible q this could you opine with certainty as an expert if a person who tries to grab the firearm which firearm fired at the distance of one foot from the firearm could it be possible the same result a possible court q could it be possible both hands fired the firearm a both hands atty alo q a person who grabs or who grapple the possession of the firearm and the firearm fires could it be possible the same result as shown in your report a it is possible dr jesus cerna medicolegal officer in his post mortem reported that from the trajectory of the bullet the direction of the gunshot was forward upward which indicated that the assailant was standing on the same level and holding the weapon on a lower position behind the victim he testified that he found no   tattooing   around the area of the wound entrance nor burning of hair he explained that the absence of   tattooing   and burning of the hair meant that the barrel of the gun was not less than 24 inches away from the head of the victim during cross examination dr cerna did not discount the possibility that the same gunshot wound in the victim may be made if the victim herself held the gun and someone tried to grapple the gun away from her head before it fired he testified as follows court q considering that you found in your examination the gunshot at the back of the head what could have been the probable position of the victim at the time she was shot she was facing a as i said your honor the gun was fired from behind so the assailant was behind because the entrance of the wound was at the back of the head q were there powder burns a when i examined the skin of the wound of entrance and when i examined the head for possible presence of burning of the hair i was not able to find powder burns fiscal cavada q which could be a sign of what doctor a considering that it is a gunshot wound if the distance of the nozzle of the gun from the skin of the victim or hair of the victim is within 2 to 3 inches in case of a short arm or 5 to 6 inches in case of a long arm there will be burning of the hair because the flame which came out of the barrel of the gun would traverse from 2 to 3 inches in case of short arms and 5 to 6 inches in case of long arms and considering also that there is no sign of powder burns of the skin and based on the forensic method of medicine tattoo can be found from the nozzle if the gun is within 24 inches from the skin of the victim and since there is no sign of tattooing so i can safely conclude that the distance from the barrel of the gun to the victim is beyond 24 inches  emphasis ours  x x x x x x x x x q doctor did you really exert efforts to find out whether there were powder burns on the body of the victim particularly burns on the body of the victim particularly on the vicinity of the wound a yes sir when i particularly examine a victim of violent death like shooting i always make it a point that i will look for the presence of tattooing on the wound of entrance and if the wound of entrance is found on the head which is covered by hair i will always see the hair so that the scalp of the skin of the head would be exposed if there will be tattooing that could be seen x x x x x x x x x q now doctor could you point to us just exactly where you found the wound of the victim with your own head using as a reference a now that gunshot wound was exactly 110 centimeters from the opening of the left ear or head behind this one and 20 centimeters below the left external auditory meatus which is located here in this portion q now will you please now let us come to a hypothetical problem the situation is where the victim was holding a revolver or the firearm on her left hand and originally the victim was pointing the gun slowly upward on her left temple and another person grabbed the firearm and pushed it backward and the victim would insist to shoot herself and that causes the firearm fired now could this kind of wound be produced a well with that position that could be possible direct examination conducted by fiscal cacada fiscal cavada q as shown in exh g the first photo and exh g1 the deceased as alleged by the accused to be in this position putting a revolver pointed to her temple with her left hand and the accused using both hands trying to wrest position of the firearm exh g3 still the accused holding the firearm and the wife holding the firearm; exhg4 the firearm or the tip of the firearm is pointed to the back of the head of the wife and then we note doctor the direction of the firearm in exh g4 and g5 the barrel of the firearm is pointed toward the side and in contact with the head of the wife please note the direction of the tip of the firearm it was alleged by the accused that this position in exh g5 that the firearm exploded or fired at this exh g5 please examine the pictures and tell the court if with this position of the gun when it allegedly exploded and as depicted in exh g5 your findings in the necropsy report would be consistent a first of all as to the location of the gunshot wound entrance as reflected in my necropsy report and as shown in the picture in exh g5 the location which is left occipital is consistent with the location of the wound entrance which is described in my necropsy report but as to the trajectory of the bullet is concerned in my autopsy report the trajectory was going forward and then upward now in the position of the barrel as shown in exh g5 which is going downward this would be inconsistent with the trajectory which is indicated in my autopsy report q how about the direction sideways a in my autopsy report the trajectory was from the face it was going forward upward then it is going towards the right medially and in exh g5 the direction of the barrel is pointed from the left is consistent what is inconsistent is the trajectory because as shown in picture with the barrel going downward the trajectory would have been downward while in my autopsy report it was going upward q you will observe that the tip of the barrel of the gun in exh g5 is touching the head of the victim a yes sir q with this distance between the gun and the head in connection with the head what would have been the nature of the entrance wound a considering that it is a contact fire where the barrel of the gun is touching the skin or in case of near contact fire wherein the barrel is nearly touching the skin the diameter of the entrance gunshot wound would have been bigger than the actual caliber of the firearm and as a matter of fact there will be an extensive destruction of the wound entrance and also the underlying tissues brought about by the effect of the pressure of the heat and expanded gases which is one of the effects of the gun explosion x x x x x x x x x court q and in this case is there present characteristic from your finding the entrance wound to show that it was contact fire a in case of contact fire gunshot wound located on the hairy portion of the head example like the head there will be burning of the hairs due to the effect of the flame of fire that will come out from the barrel of the gun when the gun is exploded at a distance of 24 inches no entrance location of the skin x x x x x x x x x atty alo q dr when you answer in this picture regarding exh g5 you only basing on what superficially show on the picture the lady holding the gun by her left hand and pointing the gun on the left side of the neck of the head a yes sir q you also noted that the hand and the left hand of the lady holding the gun is held by the man who represents the accused himself is that correct a what is clear here is that the left hand of the girl who is holding the firearm who was also being held by the right hand of the accused q the right hand of the accused on exh g5 is holding the left hand of the lady holding the gun a yes sir q in the matter of presence of nitrates is it not a fact that when the hand holding the gun is covered by the hand holding the gun could never be positive of nitrates because the nitrates concentrated on the cover of the hand a it is a fact that if there are factors that is for example of clothing which is worn by the person who fired the gun naturally the gunpowder will not even adhere on the skin q you will agree with me that your answer relating to exh g5 that the gun fired when the lady was pointing the gun on the side just as the accused wanted to wrest back to hold the firearm a yes sir q that is why as to question you will made to testify on the position taken as shown on the pictures that this was the time that the gun fired according to the accused there is moving of the head and in other words you only assume the second time that this position was the very position when the gun fired and according to the witness there was a struggle a as to the actual position of the hand of the victim and the position of the gun when the gun actually fired and considering that there was a struggle between accused and the victim considering that normally the strength of the accused being a man is stronger and the woman having a weaker sex than a man would the direction of the trajectory be consistent of the testimony of the accused q it is a common knowledge that men have superior strength than woman woman having weaker sex if actually the man applied force on the left hand of the victim so this could be again change the direction of the gun the victim could not be hit or the accused could have wrested the gun away from the victim the position of the hand of the accused holding the firearm toward the victim because of the force applied the gun could not have pointed to the victim anymore q you will agree with me if the middle finger is holding the gun with his forefinger on the trigger and his hand is pulled away it would also cause a motion to respond in the same way that the trigger would be pressed a there is a possibility appellant in his defense claimed the shooting of his wife was accidental according to him the gun fired when his wife and he were grappling for the gun as he tried to prevent the victim from shooting herself he said his wife with the gun on her left hand pointed the gun at her left temple first he held her hand with both of his hands; then he held her elbow with the tip of the barrel of the gun still touching the back of her neck as he pulled her hand away the gun fired he testified as follows q when you heard your wife murmuring that she will commit suicide what did you do if any a i saw that on her left hand she was holding a revolver pointing to her left head or left temple q now what about her right hand did you come to notice what she was holding a she was holding in her right hand the holster of the revolver q alright now when you saw that your wife was holding a revolver with her left hand on the verge of committing suicide with her right hand holding the holster what did you do as a husband a when i saw her holding the revolver pointed at her left temple i said dont day  witness demonstrating to the court that he was holding the left arm of his wife xxx xxx xxx court the accused was sitting about one foot distance to the interpreter who is representing the wife who is holding the revolver placed the revolver on his left temple the accused is holding the left hand of the interpreter who is supposed to be his wife with both hands of the accused the right hand of the accused is holding the upper wrist and the left hand is holding the elbow with the firearm pointing to the right at the back side of the neck of the interpreter who is representing the wife directed to the side of the neck the fire arm directed towards the left and the tip of the barrel is touching on the outer side touching the back portion back portion  sic  resting proceed atty alo q now that was your relative position to your wife when you tried to grab the firearm in that position now when you tried to pull away the firearm from your wife what did your wife do a she pulled her hand and resisted to pull back the firearm towards her head and the firearm fired interpreter at that instant the barrel of the gun is pointed to the neck below the left ear around 2 inches atty alo q now that was the motion of the left hand of your wife a yes q now what was the movement of the head when she was resisting in order that the gun went at the back of the head a she turned her head towards her right and still pointing the gun to her head x x x x x x x x x q now at the time of the incident when you were lying on your bed where was your child a at my right side sleeping q now when or at the time of the incident where was your child a on the bed at my right side q did you come to know what happened to your daughter when the gun bursts or when the gunburst  sic  was heard a she was still sleeping although during the direct examination there was a reenactment of incident the court upon request of the prosecution the court also allowed another reenactment to be photographed which on record was objected to by the defense the photographs of the second reenactment showed the tip of the guns barrel in contact with the victims head during the redirect examination of the appellant the defense claimed that due to the struggle of the spouses over the gun the victims head moved away from the gun and simultaneously since the appellant was stronger he was able to draw the gun away from the victims head these simultaneous movements of the victims head and the gun could explain why the wound was not a contact wound thus the defense argued appellants claim was consistent with the autopsy report of dr cerna on the absence of   tattooing   and burning of the hair of the victim as testified to by appellant on redirect atty alo now you said that you tried to pull the left arm of your wife away from you and she resisted by pulling back the firearm and pointed the gun at her head now could you tell the court at what position of your pulling away the left arm of your wife and the pulling back of the firearm by your wife did the gun burst a when she tried to pull back the firearm towards herself the gun fired q now what about the motion of her head how did your wife remove her head in consonance of the move of her head when she resisted your holding of the gun fiscal cavada the witness demonstrated by holding the gun with his left hand directed towards the left side of his head with the hand and the head was turning towards the right saying that that was the time that his wife tried to resist and pulled the gun and the hand was also following the head during rebuttal the prosecution presented the mother of the victim felisa pardillo to establish that the victim was righthanded and that the appellants allegation that she was holding the fatal weapon on her left hand was unnatural but on surrebuttal appellant said his wife was ambidextrous

eyewitnesses were familiar with the appellant juanito caballero knew him for the former grew up with the latters family victor juguillon also knew him well for victor used to visit the barrio where appellant lived while the latter frequently visited the town proper where victor resided furthermore victors cousin was married to one of the aspirases during the actual shooting incident both eyewitnesses were seated at the eastern side of the stage where they had a good view of the people in the basketball court they were only about 3 to 5 meters away from the assailant and could easily see the assailants face lastly there were seven to eight electric bulbs illuminating the meeting area with the use of a sketch marked as exhibit   1   for the defense victor showed that there was one bulb at the middle of the stage one at the center of the basketball court and   others from the center connecting the bulb   with this illumination considering where the victim and the assailant were victor and juanito could clearly see appellants face the autopsy conducted by dr llamas the medicolegal officer corroborated the testimony of the two eyewitnesses dr llamas said that there were three bullets that entered the body of the victim this supports the testimony of juanito and victor that they heard three gun reports dr llamas described the wounds of the victim and calculated the approximate position of the assailant gunshot wound no 1 showed that the victim was hit at the abdomen and the assailant was in front of the former; and that it was possible the bullet split into two one imbeded in the vertebra bone and the other exited in wound no 6 gunshot wound no 2 showed that the bullet entered the arm and then exited in the armpit which caused wound no 3 wound no 4 was the entrance of a bullet which exited in the right shoulder producing wound no 7 wound no 5 exited in wound no 8 at the chest right level of the 6th rib along the midaxillary line wounds no 2 4 and 5 showed the assailant was at the left side of the victim these findings are in harmony with the testimony of the two eyewitnesses that assailant was in front of the victim when the former shot the latter; that the victim rolled down after the first shot towards the western portion of the stage; and that before assailant fired the third shot he took one step forward dr llamas said that he could not determine whether the assailant fired the gun at close range because of the absence of powder burns however he estimated the distance between the assailant and the victim to be more than 30 inches this concurs with the testimony of juanito and victor that appellant was more or less three meters away from the victim when the former shot the latter appellants alibi was that on april 6 1992

and went to his room to get his gun he fired the gun downwards to make his father stop censuring him he then went out of the house through the kitchen door but his father still followed and threatened to hack him with a bolo he was so embarrassed that he lost control of himself and shot his father twice he promptly left the scene but soon thereafter surrendered to the police authorities in its brief for appellant the defense raised a lone assignment of error to the effect that the   the trial court erred in convicting accusedappellant despite the fact that he had acted in legitimate selfdefense  the claim of selfdefense is untenable when an accused admits killing the victim but invokes selfdefense to escape criminal liability he assumes the burden to establish his plea by credible clear and convincing evidencein order that the plea of selfdefense can prevail three basic conditions must concur ie  1  unlawful aggression on the part of the victim  2  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it and  3  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himselfunlawful aggression presupposes an actual sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger on the life and limb of a person defending himselfand not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude the aggression must be real and not just imaginarythe testimony of appellant himself easily negates any showing of unlawful aggression on the part of his father observe his testimony  q on july 16 2000 at or about 600 oclock in the evening at sto domingo iriga city while you were at your house together with your father what happened if any a now there was a birthday celebration in connection of the birthday of my brother and a drinking spree was held q what is the name of your brother a christopher q what happened between you and your father at around 600 oclock in the evening on said date and time and year and place a we had an altercation q and what is that altercation about between you and your father a i cannot understand sir he suddenly got mad at me q and what happened when your father suddenly got mad at you a i told my father not to scold me anymore as there were very many people there it was shameful on my part q then what happened when you told that to your father a he continued scolding me q by the way you mentioned papa is that the way you call your father a yes sir q so what happened when your papa continued to scold you a i left q where did you proceed a i entered my room to put a stop to his scolding q and after you entered your room what happened next a he continued scolding me so what i did was i took my gun and then fired downward q why did you fire your gun downward a in order for my father to stop scolding me as there were so many people i was getting embarrassed q after firing your gun downward what happened next a i went out of the house through the kitchen q why did you went out the house through the kitchen mr witness a so i could leave the place q were you able to leave the house through the kitchen a yes sir q and what happened when you were able to go out the house a now i went out of the house so i could leave the place but after i went out of the house i saw my father followed me closely q and what happened when your father followed you closely a he was still scolding me and he was carrying a bolo q what happened when you noticed that your father followed you closely and he had a bolo a he was about to hack me i told him not to do it because i was going to leave pros tagum your honor we will object to the testimony of this witness because it is not one of those purposes for which this witness is being offered in evidence atty cabaltera that is precisely your honor part of the mitigating circumstances of sufficient provocation or threat on the part of the offended party that immediately preceded the act court let him answer atty cabaltera okay q what happened next after that a he was still scolding me he threatened to hack me q after he threatened to hack you what did you do next if any a now as he was still scolding me and i was getting so much embarrassed now i saw something dark and i shot my father my vision darkened and i was able to shoot my father q for how many times did you shoot your father a two  2  times q why two  2  shots a i was not able to control myself  nothing in the testimony would suggest the attendance of a kind of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim that can justify appellants claim of selfdefense a mere perception of an impending attack is not sufficient to constitute unlawful aggression and neither is an intimidating or threatening attitudethe trial court correctly appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender verily appellant voluntarily surrendered himself to the authorities shortly after the shooting incident

for said reason he fired another warning shot and at the same time retreating towards barangay manoling being followed by accused francisco baltar jr and reported the incident to their team leader accused francisco baltar jr further testified that a day before january 29 1994 at around 400 oclock he was waylaid by two  2  persons whom he failed to identify said two  2  persons even chased him but they failed to catch him the incident was reported by him to their detachment at barangay manoling pres roxas capiz; however no action was made since the identity of said persons were not knownin the present case unity of design or objective can easily be inferred from the concerted acts of the three accused note that they arrived riding the same truck looking for trouble they challenged anyone who would dare fight them there being no response accused rolly baltar pointed out that the victim mariano celino jr was in the plaza and all three proceeded towards the said place finding their target at the basketball court rolly baltar boxed and dealt blows on the victim then shouted for francisco baltar jr to shoot the victim francisco baltar jr complied and shot the victim thereby causing his death all throughout accusedappellant primo villanueva accompanied them standing just a short distance behind francisco baltar jr while holding a firearm his presence not only gave moral support to the two other accused but likewise reinforced the aggression by serving as a deterrent so that the people nearby would not even think of helping the victim in fact accusedappellant even fired warning shots to prevent the people approaching  which included virgilio celino the victims brother  from coming to the victims aid accusedappellants contention that he merely fired a warning shot towards the crowd in order to protect himself is hardly believable because if it were true that he merely wanted to protect himself then he could have simply moved away from where the victim was however instead of doing so he remained where he was and succeeded in driving back the people who attempted to aid the victim thus defending assailants position and insuring the commission of the felony moreover accusedappellant committed no act whatsoever to indicate that he and the two other accused were not coconspirators as he even fled with them after francisco baltar jr had shot the victim thus their conspiracy is evident notwithstanding the accusedappellants claim that he did not do anything to the victim it must be remembered that in conspiracy evidence need not establish the actual agreement among the conspirators showing a preconceived plan or motive for the commission of the crime proof of concerted action before during and after the crime which demonstrates their unity of design and objective is sufficientthus having shown that the three accused were in conspiracy thru their concerted acts there is collective criminal responsibility since   all the conspirators are liable as principals regardless of the extent and character of their participation because the act of one is the act of all  taking advantage of superior strength alleged as generic aggravating circumstance cannot be appreciated in the present case since the prosecution was not able to prove that the accused purposely used excessive force in the commission of the crimethe aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength depends on the age size and strength of the parties it is considered whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor assessing a superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor which is selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crimewhile it may be conceded that the three accused outnumbered the victim who was unarmed it must be pointed out that numerical superiority does not always mean abuse of superiorityunder the facts of the case the two accused namely rolly baltar and francisco baltar jr attacked the victim alternately that is one after the other first rolly baltar boxed the victim then summoned francisco baltar jr to shoot him there was no notorious inequality of force shown to have been employed in the killingin other words the three accused did not secure advantage of their combined strength to perpetrate the crime with impunityindeed when the attack was made on the victim alternately there is no abuse of superior strength

fifty  50  meters and agreed on the purchase of some ducks from mendoza although mendoza was not playing he nonetheless urged farnacio to allow him  mendoza  to finish the game he was watching just when farnacio and mendoza were about to leave for the latters house mendoza stumbled on a stone and tripped hitting the mahjong table this angered the deceased prompting him to rise and draw a knife despite the apologies of mendoza the other accused johnny sanchez allegedly tried to pacify the deceased but was warned not to meddle it was at this point when sanchez allegedly hacked the deceased on the left side of his face using a widebladed bolo 6 farnacio further testified that during the commotion everyone scampered mendoza dashed to an unspecified direction while he  farnacio  boarded his tricycle for home farnacio admitted however that since then he had not been called by the police nor by any person to testify or take his testimony he claimed that he did not report the matter to the authorities because of fear aside from the fact that he did not know them as he was residing in another barangay he further asserted that he neither saw nor intended to see mendoza after the incident the accused mendoza corroborated the testimony of his witness farnacio mendoza admitted personally knowing the deceased as well as his coaccused johnny sanchez and averred that when he arrived at the mahjong parlor the deceased was already fighting with somebody as the former was mumbling angry words against johnny sanchez mendoza further testified that he had not been investigated although he

revolver while the man in blue uniform was holding a shotgun after seeing this he then ran towards the barangay road while running another shot was fired coming from the same direction after running a short distance he hid behind a mango tree in order to see what was happening he saw the two assailants running towards the direction of the house of jose hao located in barangay aguilar he then proceeded to barangay aguilar to inform the barangay captain and the barangay councilors of what transpired upon being apprised of the incident the barangay captain a certain rogelio talaban and two barangay councilors went to look for a vehicle to use in going to dominador dacones in order to transport him to the hospital after finding a vehicle they went to the place where dominador dacones had

hemoperitonium 1500 cc cause of death internal hemorrhage due to laceration of liver and right kidney as a direct result of gunshot  pellet  wounds based on his findings dr jabasa concluded that the assailant was on the right side of the victim and standing on a slightly higher elevation when the shot was fired he based this conclusion from the fact that the gunshot injuries of dominador dacones were located on the side of the victims body adjacent to the middle third portion of the right arm and in downward direction he also observed that the assailant used a 12gauge shotgun because of the size of the pellets which punctured the victims body since the other three pellets exited the body of the victim he also stated that the pellets damaged the liver and right kidney of the victim thus causing his death rosemarie dacones testified that her husband dominador dacones was buried on 10 april 1991 she spent thirtyseven thousand three hundred twentyfive pesos  p3732500  on burial expenses

 years old when he died the testimony of ofelia canja was presented to shed light with regard to the presence of a security guard in the mango orchard of jose hao she testified that she and her relatives are the owners of the landholdings where dominador dacones and his family live as tenants their landholdings adjoin the mango orchard of jose hao she had a disagreement with jose hao due to the latters claim that her tenants were picking mangoes from his orchard without permission because of this jose hao fence his orchard however by fencing his property the narrow path used by the witness tenants in going to the barangay road was closed although there are two paths which may be used by the witness tenants in going to and from her landholdings her tenants preferred the path through the orchard of jose hao since it has a shorter route jose hao also informed the witness that he will be placing a guard on his fenced to protect his mangoes finally the prosecution presented spo4 nemesio elevencione he testified that he was the police officer on duty when the crime was reported he identified the firearm allegedly used by the accusedappellant in shooting dominador dacones he also stated that the firearm was entrusted to him by accusedappellant himself on the other hand the defense presented two witnesses namely accusedappellant and roland breta accusedappellant admitted to killing dominador dacones but claimed selfdefense with regard to roland breta he denied having any participation in the death of dominador dacones accusedappellant testified that prior to the incident he had been working as a security guard in the orchard of jose hao for only three  3  dayshis task was to guard the orchard against trespassers on 25 march 1991 he was on duty in the orchard of jose hao during his tour of duty roland breta accompanied him while patrolling at around 830 pm he noticed four  4  person standing at the gate of the fence of the orchard the moon was bright on that night thus enabling him to see the faces of these four  4  persons he heard someone from the group say that they should be let inside then another one said that they should crawl under the fence since it is the shortest way back to their house then another one retorted   come what may lets get inside    bahala na sudlon ta  when the group was already inside accusedappellant accosted them and asked who they were dominador dacones then said   its me   and then drew a gun from his waist and gestured as if to shoot accusedappellant in response accusedappellant who was then standing five  5  meters away from dominador dacones fired his 12gauge burmingham shotgun at the latter dominador dacones was hit and thus lost his grip on his gun when the victim fell he was still alive but he was already having a hard time breathing accusedappellant then went to the overseer  kabo  of the orchard to inform the latter of what happened he told the overseer that he intended to surrender however the overseer advised him not to surrender and to just wait for the police the following day the police went to his house upon being asked by the police if he was responsible for the death of dominador dacones he responded in negative the police did not arrest him on this visit since they did not have a warrant of arrest however on the second visit of the police on 27 may 1991 they were already armed with a warrant by virtue of which they arrested accusedappellant roland breta testified that he was employed by jose hao as the latters caretaker of his mango treeshe had been working for jose hao for six  6  months prior to the incident on 25 march 1991 at around 830 pm he was with accusedappellant watching over the mango trees in the orchard while going about their duties they saw four  4  armed men entering the fence of the orchard after gaining entrance accusedappellant asked who they were one among the group said   i   and thereafter drew his firearm upon seeing the firearm the witness ran towards his house while running he heard a shot fired he turned his head and saw accusedappellant holding his 12gauge shotgun he then someone among the group fire back upon reaching his house accusedappellant arrived after fifteen  15  seconds accusedappellant informed him that he shot somebody he then advised accusedappellant to inform their supervisor about the incident upon being asked if he also carried a gun at the time of the incident he answered in the negative in this regard he denied having shot dominador dacones in the present case accusedappellant claims that after asking dominador dacones about his identity the latter instigated the aggression by drawing a revolver from his waist and gestured as if to fire the same at him sensing a threat to his life accusedappellant followed his natural instinct of selfpreservation and responded by firing his shotgun at dominador dacones thus claims selfdefense we are not convinced as accusedappellant was holding a 12gauge shotgun ready to fire at the intruders who entered into the fenced orchard he was guarding it is highly improbable that the victim would be so foolhardy to still attempt to draw a tucked sidearm from his waist knowing that accusedappellants finger was already on the trigger of the shotgun moreover accusedappellants claim that dominador dacones was armed with a revolver is very difficult to believe the revolver supposedly used by the victim was never even presented in evidence accusedappellant conveniently explained that although he saw where the alleged revolver fell he did not bother to get the firearm if he really acted in selfdefense he should have taken possession of the gun as evidence in order to prove his innocence another factor which militates against accusedappellants claim of selfdefense is the fact that he did not voluntarily surrender to the proper authorities and opted to remain silent about the incident a person claiming selfdefense would have reported the incident to the police as he has nothing to hide accusedappellants excuse that he was advised by the orchards overseer to just await the police cannot merit credibility in fact the overseer was not even presented in court to corroborate accusedappellants assertion that he was counseled not to surrender since there was no unlawful aggression on the part of the victim accusedappellants claim of selfdefense must fail treachery is present when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons employing means methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make to appreciate treachery two conditions must be present to wit  1  the employment of means of execution that give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and  2  the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted on the other hand there is abuse of superior strength when there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor like treachery this qualifying circumstance can only be appreciated if it is clearly shown that there was a deliberate intent on the part of the aggressor to take advantage thereof if abuse of superior strength coexist with treachery in the commission of the crime the former is absorbed in the latter and as such only the latter aggravating circumstance will be appreciated the factual milieu of the present case does not sufficiently prove that accusedappellant employed means which would ensure the execution of the crime without risk to himself when accusedappellant attacked the victims group of four  4  individuals he certainly took some risk because he was not in the position to assure himself that the persons attacked would not fight back considering their numerical advantage it was not conclusively proven from the testimonies of the eyewitnesses for the prosecution ricardo gadot jr and roger gadot that the accusedappellant pondered upon the mode or method to insure the killing of the victim as previously discussed treachery can only be appreciated if the aggressor employed means methods or forms in the commission of the crime which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make with regard to the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength this cannot likewise be appreciated against accusedappellant since the same was not adequately established the prosecution did not present any direct proof that accusedappellant took advantage of his superior strength in inflicting harm upon his victim whose group outnumbered him four to one

ran towards his house which was a few meters away the assailants followed valmoria but failed to further hit the victim because valmoria was able to hide inside his house all of the accused shouted for valmoria to come out but the latter refused causing his four assailants to hit the walls and windows of the valmoria residence during this time the victim remained seated inside the house shortly thereafter valmoria started to complain of dizziness and pain in his head which was bleeding at that time consequently at the request of valmoria his parents accompanied him to the house of witness

valmoria died the prosecution likewise presented dr edmundo visitacion jr who had conducted the necropsy which established the cause of death of valmoria indicated in the post mortem certificate he explained that the head injury sustained by the victim caused by a blunt external trauma probably made by a solid object and this trauma caused the subdular hemorrhage on december 12 1990 the parents of the victim and those of the accused salison and dignaran entered into a written agreement for the refund of hospital expenses of valmoria however no reinbursement was actually made on the other hand the lone defense witness was appellant salison himself who merely denied having killed the victim he testified that on that day together with his friends andiente dignaran fideles and a certain andy he was visiting his girlfriend a certain neneng edpalina when he heard valmoria and andiente shouting at each other he tried to pacify the two but the victim told him not to interfere because he

house he had just grabbed the piece of wood from andiente when two cafgus arrived and arrested him andiente dignaran and fideles all of them were subsequently released after the investigation

his house in calindagan dumaguete city from around 8 oclock in the morning up to 11 oclock in the evening attending the seminarthe defense also presented as its witness patrolman fred redira who testified that on the night of the incident one celso turtal reported to him that he  turtal  was requested by the wife of the victim to inform the authorities that the victim was shot by   unidentified men  the defense also presented patrolman antonio ramirez the officerincharge of the police stationand the custodian of the police logbook containing the aforesaid report patrolman ramirez testified that he prepared the affidavits of elvie and florida sido wherein they stated that the persons who shot the victim were pablito rendoque and esperato salaquin only however patrolman ramirez claimed that the municipal mayor borrowed the affidavits and never returned them again he also testified that the affidavits of elvie and florida sido which were presented to him in court for identification were new affidavits and not the ones which he preparedthe two eyewitnesses elvie and florida sido positively identified appellants as the perpetrators of the fatal shootingboth clearly narrated on the witness stand the extent of the appellants participation in the incident they categorically testified that appellant pablito rendoque gave the order to   fire  and in obedience to such order appellants esperato salaquin and quinciano rendoque jr fired their guns  known locally as   baliontod    against the victimwitness elvie sido said that as the shooting was going on she was rooted on the spot looking at the faces of the men firing at her fatheralthough the incident occurred at nighttime the house of the victim was sufficiently illuminated by two kerosene lamps  lamparillas  one carried by the daughter of the victim and another located near the victimwhich cast enough light for purposes of identification numerous cases have held that illumination coming from a kerosene lamp  also called   gasera    is sufficient for purposes of identification of an assailantaside from the sufficient lighting the two eyewitnesses were familiar with the faces of the assailants because they were townmatesand appellants did not even bother to hide their identities by covering their facesappellants admitted that they could not ascribe any illmotive against the prosecution witnesses to falsely testify against themabsent any evidence showing any reason or motive for prosecution witnesses to perjure the logical conclusion is that no such improper motive exists and their testimonies are thus worthy of full faith and creditthe fact that the witnesses were the daughter and the widow of the deceased could not impair their credibility blood or conjugal relationship between a witness and the victim does not per se impair the credibility of the witness on the contrary relationship itself could strengthen credibility in a particular case for it is unnatural for an aggrieved relative to falsely accuse someone other than the actual culprit the earnest desire to seek justice for a dead kin is not served should the witness abandon his conscience and prudence to blame one who is innocent of the crime  
murder, albert fernandez was the only witness in the killing of his father antonio fernandez in open court he positively identified armando and eduardo gaviola as the culprits armando denied the accusation but the trial court relied on the testimony of albert fernandez albert fernandez testified that on the night of july 29 1994 at around 1100 oclock he was working inside their house when he heard a noise outside he went out to investigate and he saw accusedappellant armando gaviola hack his father antonio fernandez with a bolo hitting him on the right forearm antonio fell to the ground and eduardo gaviola stabbed him in the stomach and buttocks accusedappellant then tried to hack albert but the latter was able to hold his hand and grapple for possession of the bolo a patrol car arrived prompting accusedappellant and eduardo gaviola to run away albert rushed his father to the hospital where he died three  3  days later due to injuries he sustained which developed   severe infection secondary to gangrene in the right firearm  brought about by   contamination of the instrument used in the hacking  accusedappellant however narrated a totally different story he claimed to have acted in selfdefense he averred that on the night of the incident he heard his fellow   trisikad   driver tommy mihiyo cry for help he went to render assistance and he saw antonio and albert fernandez mauling mihiyo he pacified and separated the protagonists antonio and albert fernandez then left and accusedappellant attempted to bring mihiyo to the hospital but in no time antonio and albert fernandez were back this time antonio was armed with a scythe while albert brought with him a metal tube with nail bullets allegedly the fernandezes attacked accusedappellant but he was able to evade the blows he was able to wrest possession of the scythe from antonio in their struggle and while acting in selfdefense accusedappellant appellant hit antonio on different parts of his body which eventually led to his death  
parricide, that on or about november 5 1993 in the municipality of cabuyao province of laguna and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court accused isaias castillo y completo while conveniently armed with illegally possessed sling and deadly arrow with intent to kill his wife consorcia antiporta with whom he was united in lawful wedlock did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously shot and hit his wife consorcia antiporta with the aforesaid deadly arrow hitting the latter on the right side of her neck causing the laceration of the jugular vein which caused her instantaneous death contrary to lawthe case was docketed as criminal case no 8590b and raffled to branch 24 of the regional trial court of bi n laguna appellant entered a plea of not guilty when arraigned on april 15 1994 trial thereafter ensued the facts as found by the trial court are as follows there is no dispute that the victim consorcia antiporta castillo died violently in the evening of november 5 1993 the cause of her death was massive hemorrhage due to   laceration of the jugular vein of her neck   according to dr solita p plastina municipal health officer of calamba laguna who conducted the autopsy on the victims body the fatal weapon could have been a   pointed instrument like a nail   there is no dispute likewise that the accused shot with a dart from a rubber sling his wife hitting her at the neck and causing her instantaneous death the letters written by the accused from his detention cell addressed to his motherinlaw to his fatherinlaw and lastly the victims sister speak so eloquently of someone who accepts the fault for the early demise of the victim asking forgiveness from the close relatives of the victim is a clear admission of authorship of the fatal act in the same letters the accused raised as an issue his lack of intent to do the fatal harm to his wife this is the same issue to be resolved by this court whether or not the fatal injury sustained by the victim was accidental x x x x guillermo antiporta father of the victim narrated in court that in the evening of november 5 1993 between 900 oclock to 1000 oclock the accused came home drunk and was in an angry mood the accused kicked the door and table and then threw the electric fan away he was prevailed upon by guillermo to take a rest but the accused did not heed the advice of guillermo as he took instead his sling and arrow from the house ceiling where he was keeping them dejectedly guillermo transferred to the adjacent house of her x x x daughter [inlaw] yolanda from there guillermo heard the victim crying and afterwards shouting at the accused guillermo concernedly ordered yolanda to see what was happening inside the house of consorcia and yolanda obeyed on her way yolanda met the accused carrying the bloodied body of consorcia guillermo the accused and yolanda brought consorcia to the hospital but to no avail from all the circumstances gathered the infliction of the fatal injury upon consorcia was preceded by a quarrel between her and the accused this spat negated the accuseds version that he was practicing the use of the weapon when consorcia was hit by the arrow and lends credence to the prosecutions contention that the shooting was intentional x x x to sustain the accuseds assertion that he was practicing the use of said weapon at the time of the incident is patently absurd the defense even failed to rebut guillermo antiportas testimony that the accused was keeping said sling and arrow inside his house it might be true that the accused was one of those who rushed the victim to the hospital and while on the way he sounded remorseful but guillermo antiporta further testified that while the victim was being attended to by the medical personnel of said hospital the accused stayed outside the hospital premises then he disappeared he was later on apprehended by police authorities while hiding inside the comfort room of a premises in an adjoining barangay the accuseds omission to surrender himself to the authorities is a clear indication of guiltas abovediscussed it is contrary to human nature for a husband to leave his dying wife more so if his absence is unexplained appellant did not offer any explanation for his flight in appellants brief he claimed that in   all probability it might have happened that he  appellant  was merely answering the call of nature at the precise time when he was arrested  however we find it is highly illogical for appellant to go as far as the adjoining barangay to answer the call of nature especially since he could do so inside the premises of the hospital moreover the allegation that he was fearful of reprisal coming from the victims relativesis contrary to his claim of innocence third the location of the wound and its extent likewise proved appellants intent to kill the victim the autopsy report revealed that the victim sustained a punctured wound in the neck a vital organ which fatally lacerated her jugular vein causing massive hemorrhage the extent of the physical injury inflicted on the deceased manifests appellants intention to extinguish lifefourth as regards appellants act of carrying the body of his wounded wife and bringing her to the hospital the same does not manifest innocence it is merely an indication of an act of repentance or contrition on the part of appellantin fine all these circumstances prove appellants intent to harm his wife there is likewise no merit in appellants contention that he was not the one who shot the deadly arrow because at the time of the incident he and his drinking buddies were all playing and practicing target shooting with the use of the sling and arrow prosecution witness guillermo antiporta categorically testified that appellant was alone with his wife inside their house when the incident happened this completely discounts the possibility that other than appellant there could be another person or persons who could have perpetrated the crime there is no paucity of evidence because the time when guillermo left the appellant and the victim up to the time yolanda saw him carrying his wife were all accounted for moreover the testimony of defense witness galang supports the prosecutions contention that appellant was alone with his wife at the time of the incident as noted by the court of appeals defense witness jose nelson galang testified that he left his drinking buddies and headed home at about 900 pm as in fact he was already in bed at about 1000 pm when he saw that consortia was being rushed to the hospital instead of weakening the evidence for the prosecution galangs testimony even supports the prosecutions version that between 900 pm and 1000 pm of that fateful night accusedappellant arrived at their house drunk presumably going home from that drinking session with his friends x x x

murder, this case involves a lessee of public forest land and a group of squatters evidence for the prosecution disclosed that romulo ramos is the lessee of 960 hectares of public forest land in the sitio of daeg barrio of bala municipality of bansalan davao subsequently he converted the leased land into a ranch on which he constructed the ranch houses for his cowhands one on the lower part of the ranch called ranch house no 1 and the other on the upper part thereof known as ranch house no 2 in the latter lived jose tirol roberto tirol julian daroy and the deceased doneza all cowhands of ramos at about ten oclock in the evening of december 13 1957; while the occupants of ranch house no 2 were asleep there came a succession of shots from the eastern side of the house awakened the cowhands took cover and laid flat on the floor not budging from their prone positions until early in the morning when they found one of their companions danilo doneza wounded near the left ear on that same morning of december 14 1957 doneza was brought to a certain dr villamin for treatment and thence to dr carlos in digos davao however due to the gravity of the wound he was finally taken to the brokenshire memorial hospital in davao city where he died on december 20 1957 in the meantime the municipal police of bansalan and the 72nd pc company stationed in davao city were informed of the incident immediately they proceeded to the ranch of ramos to investigate they found ranch house no 2 riddled with bullets and empty rifle shells scattered 30 to 50 meters away from the house in the farm of the appellant mauro bacang a poncho raincoat containing assorted paraphernalia including live ammunition and two enfield rifles was discovered in the house of celso lape was found another rifle pfc tuvilla of the 72nd pc company conducted an investigation with the exception of those of celso lape the appellants declarations were reduced to writing in their written statements they admitted participation in the attack on ranch house no 2 on the night of december 13 1957 these statements were subsequently signed and acknowledged by the appellants before special counsel roque m barnes of the office of the provincial fiscal of davao the case for the prosecution is anchored mainly on the extrajudicial confessions made by the appellants with the exception of agripino fontanosa who did not make any confession teodosio umpok who was not apprehended and is still at large and celso lape whose verbal confession was not reduced to writing the appellants signed written statements relating in great detail their participation in the attack on ranch house no 2 these statements disclose that at about four oclock in the afternoon of december 13 1957 agripino fontanosa went to the house of mauro bacang at sitio laya tacul bansalan davao to persuade the latter and the other appellants who were then staying with him  ie silverio cate aquiline bacang genovevo barro macario matas and crispulo gilvero  to attack ranch house no 2 that evening; that the appellants acceded to the proposal although they initially objected after having been promised land of their own should they be successful in their mission; that after supper that evening the aforementioned appellants left the house of bacang to carry out their criminal plan; that mauro bacang and silverio cate were armed with long barreled guns while the rest carried bolos; that they dropped by the house of agripino fontanosa to inform him that they were already on their way; that they met teodosio umpok in the house of fontanosa armed with a carbine furnished by the latter; that thereafter they picked up martin cabardo alfredo cabardo and celso lape who were to guide them to the ranch house and to their places of deployment; that upon arrival in the vicinity of ranch house no 2 the defendants deployed themselves and mauro bacang silverio cate teodosio umpok and celso lape started firing at it; that the whole episode took place between eleven oclock and twelve midnight with the gunfire lasting for about thirty minutes that after the shooting they dispersed the group of mauro bacang stopping by fontanosas place once more to inform the latter of the outcome of their mission; that teodosio umpok returned the carbine of fontanosa while mauro bacang hid his gun and that of silverio cate upon arrival at the formers house while admitting the authenticity of their signatures on the extrajudicial confessions the appellants deny their voluntariness and veracity alleging that they were procured through force violence duress and intimidation specifically they testified that the pc soldiers under capt bucoy of the 72nd pc company maltreated them inflicting bruises contusions and wounds on their bodies as proof of the injuries they sustained they presented medical certificates made out by dr marcial s santos and dr dominador f mendoza of the davao general hospital this pretense of the appellants does not deserve belief except for the medical certificates issued to genovevo barro and crispulo gilvero which attest to the presence of unhealed wounds on their bodies the rest merely reveal findings of scars abrasions discolorations and complaints of pain the appellants claim that this was because the medical examination was conducted only on january 6 1958 or eighteen days after their confinement in the pc barracks at davao city where the alleged maltreatment took place note must however be taken of the fact that the counsel for the accused in the lower court had seen these wounds as early as december 23 1957 nevertheless they were not brought to the immediate attention of a physician for proper examination as the lower court observed in its decision if the accused were still suffering from injuries and the injuries were visible on their bodies on december 23 1957 when their lawyer atty buagas saw them at the provincial wardens office there was no sufficient reason why atty buagas did not at once or the next day took  sic  them to the hospital for medical examination the excuse that there was lack of guards at the provincial jail is not convincing even granting arguendo that there was lack of guards and no definite time could be ascertained as to when a guard could be available atty buagas would have taken a doctor to the provincial jail to examine physically the accused before the injuries healed atty buagas would not wait until january 6 1958 considering that the accused told him that they were forced to make confessions when the accused were finally examined on january 6 1958 they were able to show only healed wounds scratches or mere complaints of pain which a doctor can not verify as for the wound of genovevo barro described in his medical certificate as   contusion xyphoid process   the examining physician testified on crossexamination by the fiscal that it was apparently inflicted only three days before his physical examination a similar disclosure was made with respect to the unhealed wound of crispulo gilvero the said wound described as   partially healed multiple posterior elbow joint right   must have been caused five or six days only prior to the doctors examination further testimony by the examining physicians brought out the fact that the appellants scars and wounds are of a superficial nature and could have been selfinflicted the appellants claim that they were coerced intimidated and browbeaten into affixing their thumbmarks and signatures on their extrajudicial confessions before special counsel roque m barnes of the provincial fiscals office is belied by the evidence on record fiscal barnes testified that after the pc soldiers brought the accused to his office they left the room at his request leaving him alone with the accused; that jose c adao a clerk of his office translated the contents of the affidavits into visayan which is understood by all the accused; that the latter affirmed the truth of their declarations; that he asked the accused if they had anything more to add to their written statements and they answered in the negative; that they voluntarily affixed their signatures and thumbmarks to their respective affidavits after which he received their oaths; and that he did not see or notice any injuries or signs of maltreatment on the bodies of the accused when they were brought to him adao corroborated the foregoing testimony he declared that a pc soldier brought the accused to the fiscals office sometime in december 1957; that he translated the contents of the affidavits into the visayan dialect; that the affiants voluntarily signed their respective written declarations in his presence; and that he did not see or notice any injuries on the bodies of the accused the constabulary officers and soldiers were no less categorical in their denial of the appellants claim of maltreatment capt antonio a bucoy head of the squad that was sent to investigate the shooting in daeg testified on rebuttal that he did not order the accused exposed to the sun or in any way maltreated likewise pfc tuvilla pc investigator testified that he did not lay hands on the appellants and neither did he threaten to illtreat them if they did not sign their respective affidavits other pc soldiers namely benigno ordinaria clemente layaguin generoso espantaleon and cesar buit corroborated the testimony of pfc tuvilla moreover the testimony of lorenzo ozam a guard at the davao provincial jail militates against the appellants allegation of having been subjected to thirddegree methods he related that he saw the appellants when they were admitted to the provincial jail on december 23 1957 but he did not see any injuries on their faces and bodies after they removed their clothes for inspection the appellants assail the veracity of the extrajudicial confessions by putting up the defense of alibi the evidence for mauro bacang silverio cate crispulo gilvero genovevo barro and aquilino bacang tended to establish their presence in pikit cotabato on the night of december 13 1957 macario matas on the other hand was allegedly in the house of a certain remegio diana a school teacher residing at padada davao on that fateful night a similar defense was raised by alfonso and martin cabardo who tried to show they were in their house in upper patolangon a part of milang cotabato and celso lape who asserted that he was in his farm at dapok milang cotabato when the incident at the ramos ranch happened after a careful examination and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence on hand we find that the appellants defense of alibi lacks that plausibility sufficient to convince us of their innocence bearing in mind the oftrepeated ruling of this court that alibi is a weak defense for it is easy to manufacture  people vs padilla 48 phil 718 731; people vs de asis 61 phil 384 389; people vs japitana and santos 77 phil 175 180; people vs estacio gr no l11430 january 30 1960  and considering too the existence of the extrajudicial confessions which on their faces and as corroborated by other evidence bespeak the true sequence of events we find the appellants evidence profferred to shore up their defense of alibi not convincing the alibi of mauro bacang and his aforementioned companions finds apparent support in the testimony of roque dandan a preacher of the united church of christ in the philippines who testified that mauro bacang and his friends dropped at his house at karapulo bansalan davao on december 7 1957 on their way to pikit cotabato and again on december 14 1957 on their way home from pikit as proof thereof he presented a notebook  exh bb  which contains a list of the persons who ate in his house on various occasions a close and careful examination of the notebook and its contents however fails to give credence to his testimony it is an old composition notebook with frayed edges the first eight pages of which contain references to biblical passages and what appears to be notes on proposed sermon the socalled list of visitors who ate in his house starts on the bottom third of the eighth page with the entry of august 2 to 5 1956 and ends on the last line of the next page with the entry of december 5 1958 except for the last two pages the rest of the notebook is blank mauro bacang and his friends are listed down as visitors on december 7 and 14 1957 while the former alone is listed down on december 16 and 18 1957 the notebook acquires significance because of the fact that its existence was brought out only on crossexamination by the fiscal it was produced in evidence only after dandan was asked to bring it to court if the entries therein were accepted as true then bacangs alibi assumes an aura of credibility however this court cannot rely on this piece of evidence while the entries were written in pencil and supposedly at various dates yet there appears no variation in the strokes nor in the shading of the pencil lines furthermore while the list of visitors is written in pencil the rest of the notations and entries in the notebook are in ink moreover the circumstance under which this notebook was produced is a bit puzzling considering that dandan is a principal witness for the defense and that all along he had been in possession of this important piece of evidence isnt it strange that he should make known its existence only after the prosecution began asking him why he would remember his dates so well wouldnt it be more logical to expect the defense to present this evidence on direct examination considering that dandan is their witness we have examined the record on this point and our doubts have not been erased by the witness answers to the probing questions of the lower court consequently we find ourselves with the court a quo in disbelieving dandans testimony neither can we accord credit to the testimony of the other witnesses for mauro bacang vicente fontanosa who was contacted allegedly by bacang in pikit and who testified that the latter was with him on the night of december 13 1957 at elys cafe is the son of agripino fontanosa one of the accused and the counsel for the squatters on the ranch of ramos elena fontilla the owner of elys cafe in pikit remembers too much for a a woman who keeps a refreshment parlor frequented by numerous persons she remembers the dates of events long past and of no moment at all when they happened  feats of memory equally displayed by the other witnesses for bacang and his companions coincidence too seems to play an important role in the defense of bacang odon romeros testimony that mauro bacang and his friends were with him it elys cafe on the night of december 13 1957 celebrating the death anniversary of his father does not deserve serious consideration as the lower court observed it was a strange coincidence that odon romero happened to be in the house of vicente fontanosa when mauro bacang and his companions went there and that odon romero celebrated the death anniversary of his father on december 13 1957 at elys cafe and mauro bacang and his inseparable companions looked for vicente fontanosa found him at elys cafe and were invited by odon romero to join in the celebration as for the alibi of macario matas we find that it is supported only by the testimony of remegio diana who is his brotherinlaw and by rosaleo nadela who admitted that he was reminded only by diana of the date when he met matas ie december 13 1957 celso lapes alibi was not corroborated by any witness the same is true with the alibi of martin cabardo in the case of alfredo cabardo only the testimony of his father julio cabardo corroborates his alibi these testimonies are inadequate to support the defense of alibi which must be proved by   positive clear and satisfactory evidence    us vs olais 36 phil 828 829  the defense attempts to dilute the strength of the prosecutions case by picturing it as one huge conspiracy among the constabulary soldier the provincial fiscals office and romulo ramos against the eleven accused the strands in this supposed web of intrigue and machinations are formed by evidence for the defense that the wound sustained by danilo doneza was caused not by a bullet but by protruding nail which pierced doneza near the left ear as he sought cover during the shooting; by assertions that doneza died of cover respiratory complications and not as a result of a gunshot wound; by the testimony of hardly credible witnesses identifying the rifles marked as exhibits c d and j as belonging not to the accused but to the cowboys of ramos; by the insinuation of crispiniano jorgio one of the defense witnesses that those who fired at ranch house no 2 were ilocanos and moros based on his having allegedly heard and seen several persons pass near his house after the shooting speaking in ilocano and wearing hats and turbans; and by the attempt to establish as a fact that ramos bribed the pc to implicate the accused in the killing of danilo doneza unfortunately for the appellants the web they constructed cannot bear the weight of the prosecutions evidence dr asuncion paraan who performed the autopsy on the body of doneza twentyfour hours after his death testified that she found an external wound below the left ear lobe   possibly an entrance wound of a gunshot

and arminggol teofe were the once  sic  actually working thereon with quibado the one incharge of the work rosanna was from time to time giving a helping hand but most of the time she was the one holding the flashlight being used in the work that was being undertaken while rosanna was holding the flashlight accused carlito ere approached and took from her the flashlight and brought the same with him to the interior of the place rosanna followed ere and when she returned she already had with her the flashlight which ere took with him ere however followed rosanna to the place where the work on the busted electric line was going on and confronted her about her taking back the flashlight rosanna explained that it was being used in the work that must be finished and when finished would be to the benefit of all the residents of the place a heated argument followed which made rosanna to move away to a place known thereat as   bato   which place consists of a low hollow block fence teofe followed her to the   bato   and with another person sat beside rosanna ere also followed rosanna and the argument between the two of them continued ere himself sat at the bato with teofe and one other person separating him from rosanna ere all of a sudden stood up and drew a bladed weapon and with it stabbed rosanna at the back this made rosanna to run towards a tricycle which happened to be in said place but ere followed her again and gave chase to rosanna resulting in a situation whereby the two of them would be running around the tricycle rodolfo dematera also happened to be in that place he tried to pacify ere but was instead hit by the latter on his left arm teofe himself was shouting to ere to stop what he was doing but the latter ignored him rosanna was able to run away from the tricycle but in the process stumbled and ere was able to catch up with her ere then held rosanna frontally by the hair and thereafter stabbed her at the chest twice rosanna slumped to the ground clutching her chest at this point teofe approached rosanna while dematera called for rosannas parents ere again approached rosanna but without actually reaching her he ran away from the place teofe tried to talk to rosanna but rosanna could not answer him anymore as blood was coming out of her mouth thereafter teofe boarded rosanna on a tricycle with which her relatives brought her somewhere else in court teofe identified ere as the assailant of rosanna he also identified the dagger which was recovered in another place as the one used by ere in stabbing rosanna teofe maintained that he had seen said dagger before in the possession of ere rosanna died by reason of the stab wounds she sustained at the back and at the chest  exhs c c1 d and f  her mother lita spent p2400000 in connection with her death and burial she is also claiming p18720000 by way of lost income which rosanna could have earned had she not been untimely killed there was also a claim for moral damages brought about by the pain and sorrow caused by rosannas untimely demise spo1 benjamin bacunata of the navotas police effected the arrest of ere shortly after he fled from the scene of rosannas stabbing an alert/alarm was issued for ere who was spotted at the corner of estrella and naval streets in navotas and identified by one hector domingo when frisked ere was found to be in possession of a small improvised bladed weapon  exh g  bacunata presented the dagger  exh h  that was recovered in another place and which teofe identified as the fatal weapon accused carlito ere denied killing rosanna whom he acknowledged he learned was stabbed to death by another person ere also denied the testimony of teofe claiming that while he really returned the flashlight to rosanna he never followed her back to the place where the work on the busted electric line was being done hence there could have been no confrontation between the two of them ere also maintained that when rosanna must have been stabbed he was already on board a passenger jeep bound for monumento he acknowledged that there was a check point in navotas whereat the jeep he was riding on was stopped followed by somebody pointing to him policeman bacunata then boarded ere on a mobile car and was brought to the police headquarters and detained positive and clear are the appropriate words that can describe the testimony given by teofe he narrated in terms simple and distinctive the incident from the time work was started on the busted electric line to the taking of the flashlight from rosanna by ere to the return of the two to the place and the argument between them that followed in the same vein he described the stabbing of rosanna by ere first at the back and then twice at the chest while ere was holding rosanna by her hair and teofe was not shown to have been motivated in giving his testimony by any evil purpose or consideration on the other hand we have eres version consisting mainly of a denial and a claim that he was already somewhere else when rosanna must have been stabbed to death erenos version also included admissions concerning his having taken the flashlight from rosanna and his having been arrested in a checkpoint after he was pointed to by domingo which checkpoint according to the arresting officer was brought about by an alert or alarm for the reported killer of rosanna accusedappellant avers that late in the night of june 21 1995 while riding in a tricycle spo1 benjamin bacunata along with elements of the navotas police station arrested and detained him at the navotas police station; that he was arrested without a warrant and was apprehended merely on the basis of a report of a certain hector domingo who did not have any personal knowledge of the identity of the accused and also of the circumstances described in the information charging him of the crime of murder; that both spo1 benjamin bacunata and hector domingo were not present at the scene of the alleged crime and that hector domingo was not even presented as a witness by the prosecution; that at the time of the arrest the accused was not doing any act which would give the arresting officers any reasonable suspicion to cause his arrest and/or to detain him; and that since his arrest is illegal the bladed weapon which was presented by the prosecution as the murder weapon must have been seized as a result of an illegal arrest and illegal search and therefore can not be presented as evidence against the accused in short the court a quo allegedly never acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accusedappellant on the other hand the office of the solicitor general in its appellees brief contends that the warrantless arrest of accusedappellant by spo1 benjamin bacunata at about 945 pm of june 21 1995 shortly after the stabbing incident of rosanna honrubia was justified under section 5  b  rule 113 of the 1985 rules of criminal procedure based on the report made to the navotas police station by eyewitness hector domingo which was shown to arresting officer spo1 benjamin bacunata the latter in effect was vested with personal knowledge of the facts surrounding the stabbing of rosanna honrubia a few hours before the arrest on june 21 1995 of accusedappellant hence spo i benjamin bacunata and the other arresting officers with him were validly compelled in the performance of their official duties to arrest accusedappellant without a warrant besides even if the warrantless arrest was unlawful and the evidence obtained  ie an improvised bladed weapon  inadmissible the conviction of accusedappellant would still be in accordance with law and the evidence because eyewitness arminggol teofe positively identified him as the assailant of rosanna honrubia and also identified the bladed weapon recovered in another place as the one used by accusedappellant in stabbing rosanna the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not established by convincing evidencethere was no showing that the means method or manner of attack was deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused and actually carried out so swiftly and unexpectedly so as to ensure his safety while rendering his victim helpless and unable to defend herselfthere is no treachery when the killing results from a verbal altercation between the victim and the assailant such that the victim must have been forewarned of the impending danger as was found in the case at barit bears stress that treachery is not presumed it has to be proved as convincingly as the killing itself

murder, the facts that on or about the 14th day of october 1985 in the municipality of calatrava province of negros occidental philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the first four  4  abovenamed accused who are still atlarge in company of their coaccused whose truenames  sic  are still unknown and designated only as alias junior delima alias nonoy cogonon alias bobby lumanog alias goliath john doe peter doe paul doe and james doe who are likewise still atlarge armed with assorted firearms conspiring confederating and mutually helping one another with intent to kill with evident premeditation and treachery did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously ambush attack and fire at the police patrol service car thereby causing the instantaneous death of ncoic/tsg ermilino tucaling pat leo oebanda and pat richard sumili and inflicting injuries upon the bodies of pfc camelo algaba pfc rogelio aburido sgt epifanio mercado and pat nestor era which would have caused their deaths; thus with respect to the lattermentioned injured victims the accused had performed all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime also of murder as a consequence but which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of some causes independent of the will of the accused that is due to the timely and able medical assistance rendered to said pfc camelo algaba pfc rogelio aburido sgt epifanio mercado and pat nestor era which prevented their death contrary to law the prosecution presented the following as witnesses pfc camilo algaba dr ramon nemenzo p/lt epifanio mercado jocelyn chan michael valencia and dr tranquilino carmona while the defense relied on the testimonies of lemy cahayagan and the accused gerardo cogonon the prosecutors offered exhs a to d2 while the defense did not present any documentary evidence the prosecutions version of the facts as adopted by the trial court at about 830 in the evening of october 14 1985 a certain heminiano clemen alias   maning   went to the police station of calatrava negros occidental to report the presence of armed men in the house of tirso claro a barangay councilman of barangay lemery among the armed men was nonoy cogonon in response thereto t/sgt ermelino tucaling the station commander organized a team to verify the report headed by tucaling himself the team was composed of p/sgt epifanio morales pfc rogelio aburido pfc camelo algaba pat nestor era pat leo oebanda and pat richard sumili riding in their patrol vehicle a   back to back   ford fiera the team proceeded to the house of tirso claro in barangay lemery failing to find the reported armed group there they left for sitio daang lungsod where the armed men were reportedly seen and where a benefit dance was being heldhowever according to pfc camelo algabathey still failed to find the armed group at the dance hall so the team proceeded to barangay castellano where they once more failed to encounter any armed group thus they went back to sitio daang lungsod by then it was already 1000 oclock in the eveningt/sgt tucaling was driving the patrol vehicle with pat oebanda beside him riding in the back on the left side were pfc aburido and pat era with the former seated behind t/sgt tucaling at the right side of the vehicle were pat sumili  who was seated behind pat oebando  pfc algaba and p/sgt mercado while negotiating a hilly curve in sitio daang lungsod their vehicle was suddenly hit just below the windshield by a rifle grenade the explosion was swiftly followed by a volley of gunshots coming from both sides of the road the policemen returned fire as the rifle grenade hit the vehicle and exploded t/sgt tucaling lost control of the same causing it to swerve to the left side of the road hitting an embankment the vehicle stopped parallel to the road its headlights pointed in the direction of the attackers despite the exchange of gunshots the vehicles headlights remained undamaged and illuminated the ambushers thereby enabling the victims to identify them during the firefight p/sgt mercado recognized appellant nonoy cogonon whom he had known prior to the incident as a member of the civilian home defense force  chdf  he was on the left side of the road in fatigue uniform and armed with an m16 rifle mercado likewise saw   alias goliath    rodrigo romeo  guillermo empenado and   alias agui    violeto tormis  mercados identification of the assailants was corroborated by pfc algabawhen the smoke of battle  which lasted 15 minutes  cleared t/sgt tucaling pat oebanda and pat sumili were found dead on the spotwhile pfc algaba p/sgt mercado pfc aburido and pat era sustained various injuriesthe latter casualties were brought to the san carlos planters and laborers hospital for treatmentthe version of the defense for his part appellant then 23 years old interposed denial and alibi according to him he grew up in barangay lagaan calatrava negros occidental after two of his brothers were killed he relocated to barangay cruz and became a chdf member under the leadership of marcial mahilum he knew other chdf members like junior delima guillermo empenado and buenaventura entienza he was also familiar with members of the police force of calatrava like t/sgt tucaling and p/sgt mercado because he used to hang out at the municipal hall as a chdf member he was issued an m16 armalite which he claimed to have surrendered to emiliano anthony when he   rested   after the death of their leader marcial mahilum he also claimed that inasmuch as he did not formally resign from the chdf he could obtain a firearm anytimeappellant acquired a farm in barangay cruz which measured more than a hectare it was cultivated by lemy cahayagan whose house was about two  2  kilometers from his own place in the afternoon of that fateful day october 14 1985 he was allegedly in cahayagans house attending a thanksgiving party he arrived there at 500 oclock in the afternoon and had dinner at 900 oclock in the evening from then on until 1200 oclock midnight he drank tuba with lemy and camilo cahayagan eusebio caramihan carlos and lito lumanog he did not leave the cahayagan residence until 700 oclock in the morning of the following daylemy cahayagan corroborated appellants testimony adding that barangay cruz is about twenty  20  kilometers from barangay lemery and could not be reached via the national highwaythe issues as stated above the trial court convicted appellant of the crimes charged not satisfied with the decision cogonon interposed the present appeal assigning a single error the trial court erred in convicting accusedappellant gerardo cogonon of the crimes charged despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt appellant contendsthat his conviction was based on the trial courts presumption that the crime was perpetrated by the chdf of which he was a member citing as basis for his contention the following portion of the questioned decision the court perceives this [recall of firearms by the police] to be the seed of hatred which germinated in the minds of the chdf members whose guns capt ponteras had ordered withdrawn and culminated in the ambush slaying of the seven policemen this coming straight from the horses mouth as testified to by cogonon himselfthe trial court in fact added that   the ponteras order had generated an undercurrent of resentment on the part of the chdfs which motivated them to perpetrate this dastardly slaughter  according to cogonon he never testified to that effect he believes that the portion of his testimony which could have been made the basis for the trial courts conclusion is the following q it appears from the record that    by the way would you admit and agree with me that some members of the chdf were disgusted or disheartened because of that order requiring them to surrender the firearms considering that they were deprived of their protection a i do not know what they felt as i already returned minethus relying on gaerlan vs court of appealsappellant argues that his conviction cannot be predicated on a presumption or speculation but on clear and positive evidence moreover while his defense is alibi it should not be totally disregarded the possibility exists that taken in the light of all the evidence on record his alibi may suffice to acquit him since every circumstance must be considered in favor of the presumption of innocence  
murder, early in the morning of february 3 1958 rafael cabizares accompanied by his wife hospicia his brothers margarito and romualdo and his sons gumercindo marcelo casiano juan and lamberto left barrio cebuano headed for the poblacion of tupi cotabato bringing five sacks of corn loaded on a bull cart to be milled in tupi juan marcelo and lamberto who were all minors were then going to school upon approaching a hilly part they had to stop since the carabao could not pull the bull cart uphill rafael then requested his two brothers and his son gumercindo to accompany him up the hill and carry on their backs the sacks of corn with rafael leading the four proceeded uphill as the four approached sulpicio de la cernas house on top of the hill and were about to put down the sacks of corn appellant sulpicio who was in the house fired at and hit rafael who fell down sulpicio then ordered his companions to burn his house so that they would have an excuse meanwhile casiano gumercindo marcelo and romualdo brought the wounded rafael cabizares to the house of the latters father demetrio 100 meters away felisa bastismo rafaels mother ursula cabizares and segundino cabizares were there at the time after the group reached the house rafaels wounds were washed with hot water and then he was brought inside the third room of the house subsequently appellant sulpicio and the other accused arrived at the premises armed with firearms bolos and canes they stoned the house and trust their bolos thru the bamboo walls and flooring finding that there were women inside the house the accused ordered them to get out or else they would be killed also as felisa bastismo and ursula cabizares alighted from the besieged house marcelo cabizares followed them and although held by accused conrado pardillo and boxed by serapio maquiling he was able to escape to the nearby forest serapio maquiling then climbed up the window of the kitchen and with the carbine which he got from appellant sulpicio de la cerna shot at rafael cabizares who was sitting in the third room at this moment casiano cabizares jumped down from the house thru the kitchen door and ran away serapio maquiling followed him and shot the latter at the back killing him a few meters away from demetrios house appellant sulpicio de la cerna then got back the carbine climbed up the house and fired once more at rafael who was now lying down on the floor killing him finally thereafter the cadaver of casiano cabizares was tied to a bamboo pole carried by accused ramon alquizar and one wilfredo malias  at large  and placed near the burned house of sulpicio de la cerna as some of the accused followed while the rest proceeded to rafaels house the post mortem examinationconducted that very same day showed that casiano cabizares died from a gunshot wound the bullet entering the back and passing out in front while rafael cabizares sustained three gunshot wounds of entrance one gunshot exit wound and one stab wound dr bienvenido garcia the municipal health officer explained that the bullet which caused the first wound located in front at the left lower abdomen did not go thru at the back but split into two parts after entering the body however these two parts were already palpable on the left buttock of the decedent from which they were extracted the bullet which caused the second wound located directly at the back lodged in the 11th thoracic vertebra the third bullet entered near the left breast and went out at the right lumbar region the prosecution also presented proof that prior to the incident a land dispute arose between rafael and some of the accusedand that he had filed complaintswith the agrarian court against the latter the trial of which cases was scheduled on february 10 1958 appellants would have this court believe that they are innocent the four appellants convicted as accomplices insist they were never at the vicinity of the killing on the other hand appellant sulpicio de la cerna claims that both rafael and casiano were killed in selfdefense sulpicios version of what transpired is this in the morning of february 3 1958 guillermo esperanza and sulpicio de la cerna had just roasted corn in the latters house when rafael casiano and others all armed with bolos and canes arrived rafael demanded of sulpicio to come down for a confrontation the latters refusal to do so angered rafael who threw his cane at sulpicio and ordered his companions to surround the house thrust their bolos thru it and burn it because the house was on fire and fearing that he would be killed sulpicio alerted guillermo esperanza got his carbine and fired indiscriminately at his attackers to drive them away when rafael and casiano were hit their companions fled guillermo esperanza and sulpicio then got down from the burning house and left passing by the prostrate bodies of the decedents sulpicio proceeded to the house of one pedro esperanza to drink water and while there he saw a jeep coming loaded with policemen to whom be surrendered himself and his carbine expectedly guillermo esperanza gave the same version as abovenarrated said appellants version cannot be accepted the autopsy reports contradict sulpicios claim that he shot the decedents frontally while he was up in his house for both deceased each sustained a gunshot wound directly at the back moreover casianos wound of entry  located along the 12th rib  is lower than the wound of exit  located along the 6th rib showing that the bullet flight path was upwards not downwards a gun fired from the elevated flooringof a house like sulpicios and aimed downwards could not have caused such wounds lastly rafaels cadaver bore a stab wound on the left side appellants version could not account for this while on the one hand nothing was found around the burned house of appellant sulpicio de la cerna such as the alleged cane thrown by rafael nor any other weapon or stones which may indicate agression or violence on the other bloodstains were found inside demetrio cabizares houseand also on the ground at the spot where according to the prosecutioncasiano fell when shot by serapio maquiling an empty carbine shell  exh i  was also found by dr garcia in the kitchen in this regard his testimony is not hearsay as appellant contends for although dr garcia did not personally pick it up he saw the empty shell taken from the floor and handed over to his companions before finally reaching himwhile casianos body was found near sulpicios burned house even appellants own witnessadmitted having found rafaels body inside demetrios house right after the incidents occurred appellants supposition that rafaels companions must have returned and carried away his body can hardly be accepted since there is no reason why they would not also bring back casianos body 1 romualdo cabizares  he was with his brother rafael when the latter was shot near sulpicios house and was among those who brought rafael to their fathers  demetrio  house 100 meters away he did not go up the house since he had to go back and evacuate his family to a forest 400 meters away having done so he went back and saw the incidents around demetrios house from a place covered with corn plants just 25 meters away this witness was able to observe the events around demetrios house even if the corn plants where he hid were sparse because of the 25meter distance from the accused whose attentions were focused on demetrios house and considering that he was in a hidden placewhile the accused were in the open field romualdo could see them without their noticing him it is true that the forest where romualdo took his family was 400 meters away but the accused took some time before they followed to demetrios house and romualdo ran back after hiding his family margarito cabizares  he was beside his brother rafael at the hill top when the latter was shot by sulpicio when he tried to hide near some banana clumps guillermo esperanza stabbed him hitting him near the left shoulder and causing him to fall unconscious shortly later when he recovered consciousness he followed rafael who was being brought to demetrios house but he was told by rafael to save himself so he went to a forest 400 meters away where he saw the goingson around demetrios house appellants state that nothing much can be gathered from his testimony however they overlook the obvious fact that margarito was an eyewitness to the shooting of rafael near sulpicios house although he lost consciousness after being stabbed it was momentary only the wound not being very seriousit was not impossible for him to have observed activities around demetrios house at a distance of 400 meters witness bonifacio barro corroborates him on this pointlastly he need not be a ballistics expert to recognize gunshot bursts 3 gumercindo cabizares  he was with his father rafael at the hill top he warned his father just before sulpicio fired the carbine after rafael was hit he helped carry him to demetrios house but did not stay there since he was told by rafael to go to dadiangas to call the pc 4 marcelo cabizares  he was near the bullcart downhill and when he heard gun shots he went uphill there he helped carry his father rafael to his grandfather demetrios house after the accused arrived in the latters house the women were ordered to get out he followed ursula cabizares and felisa bastismo on the way down but he was held by pardillo and boxed by serapio maquiling still he was able to escape 5 juan cabizares  he also stayed with the bullcart downhill and when he heard gun shots he went uphill and saw his father wounded he then followed behind the group carrying rafael to demetrios house and while inside the house saw the killing of rafael and casiano juan did not lie when he said his father was shot by sulpicio for altho he did not see the actual shooting he had good reasons to conclude that sulpicio fired the shot since he saw the latter shortly after the shooting holding the carbine which was still pointed at rafaelanyway his testimony on the point is merely corroborative of the others who were eyewitnesses he was able to identify serapio maquiling as the one who first shot his father in demetrios house although serapio was behind the bamboo partition since there were openings in it enabling one to see thru and he peeped thru itthe measurements in the third room  3 m x 4 m  are compatible with juans statement that sulpicio was 11/2 m away from rafael when the third shot was fired since sulpicio did not go inside the room but fired from the window outsidejuan was competent to testify on what occurred outside the house since he was also peeping thru the slits in the bamboo walls felisa bastismo  she was the mother of rafael cabizares she was with ursula cabizares and segundino cabizares inside demetrios house when the wounded rafael was brought in after rafaels wounds were washed felisa went down from the house with ursula as ordered by the accused and in the corn fields nearby she witnessed the killing of casiano 7 ursula and segundino cabizares  both were in demetrios house with felisa bastismo they saw the arrival of the accused and the stoning and thrusting of bolos thru the wallings one of the bolos wounded segundino cabizares on the left thigh ursula cabizares hid in a palay container but when they were ordered to get out she and felisa bastismo left and returned later in the afternoon while ursula was evidently mistaken when she said that margarito was also in the house the error is immaterial contrary to appellants contention she saw serapio maquiling on her way down the houseas to whether the other accused besides appellant antonio bautista were armed with bolos she stated she did not know since she only saw the bolo tips penetrating thru the wallingsher positive statement that she saw appellant godofredo rotor prevails of course over the negative testimony of maximo ca appellants argue that since segundino cabizares was fearful he could not have been moving inside the besieged house of demetrio peeping every now and then thru the openings in the walls and observing the accused they seem to forget however that different people react differently even when apprehensive thus segundinos restlessness inside the house is neither unnatural or ridiculous to believe 8 bonifacio barro  he was with fiscal daproza and sgt paladin inside demetrios house a few days after february 3 1958 and upon orders of the fiscal he took out part of the flooring  exh k  the bamboo slatch  exhs l and l1  and the stones  exhs m m1 and m2  his statement that exhs m m1 and m2 were some of the stones fiscal daproza found on the roof of demetrios house corroborates the other prosecution witnesses who testified that the accused stoned the house he also stated that there were other stones inside the house corroborating romualdo cabizares dr bienvenido garcia  as municipal health officer he performed the autopsy on rafael and casiano cabizares on february 3 1958 he found casianos body near the burned house of sulpicio de la cerna and rafaels inside demetrios house in the latter house he also saw a bullet hole on the floor  exh j1  and a carbine shell  exh 1  appellants would cavil on dr garcias statement that he saw exh j  part of the flooring  only in court what he said however was that he saw it as cut already from the floor only in courthis statements as to the room dimensions  34 m x 45 m  and the distance of rafaels body to the partition  1 m or 2 ft  are approximations only and not exact measurementsa difference of a few insignificant meters is to be expected lastly his statements that the bullet hole  exhibit j1  was on the floor coincides with barros testimony that exh j was cut from the flooringthe portion of dr garcias testimonycited by appellants shows that rafael died after the third shot hit him  q after wound no 1 was inflicted is it possible that rafael cabizares was still alive a rafael cabizares was still alive q after inflicting wound no 2 is it possible that rafael cabizares was still alive a he was still alive q when wound no 3 was inflicted was he still alive by your conclusion a he was dead q what makes you conclude that he was already dead when wound no 3 was inflicted a because wound no 3 is mortal thus corroborating juan cabizares testimony that his father was still alive after the second shot wounded him although serapio got the carbine from sulpicio the latter cannot be considered a principal by indispensable cooperation or an accomplice there is no evidence at all that sulpicio was aware serapio would use the rifle to kill casiano presumably he gave the carbine to serapio for him to shoot rafael only as per their agreement neither is there concrete proof that sulpicio abetted the shooting of casiano sulpicio might have been liable if after the shooting of rafael serapio returned the carbine to him but upon seeing casiano fleeing immediately asked again for the carbine and sulpicio voluntarily gave it to him serapios criminal intention then would be reasonably apparent to sulpicio and the latters giving back of the rifle would constitute his assent thereto but such was not the case sulpicio therefore must be acquitted for the killing of casiano cabizares appellants godofredo rotor antonio bautista severino matchoca and teodoro libumfacil all put up alibi as their defense this the trial court rejected but it held them liable as accomplices only finding reasonable doubt on their guilt as coprincipals appellants would again advance their respective alibis here appellant rotor claims that at dawn on february 3 1957 he went alone to the spring in barrio cebuano to fetch water and after staying awhile there started back home on the way back his mother met him and told him not to go home because of an incident  the killing of the decedents  so he went instead to simeon navajas house and stayed there until february 18 1958 the prosecution however proved that in the early morning of february 3 1958 rotor was with maximo ca fetching water in the spring on their way home they met appellants bautista and matchoca the latter gave rotor a carbine magazine with bullets saying   here is the magazine of the bullets and give it to sulpicio de la cerna   and appellant bautista said   please hurry give it to sulpicio de la cerna because we will follow later on   shortly afterwards ca went with him to sulpicios house where he gave the magazine to sulpicio saying   here are some bullets supposed to be given to you  rotor was seen outside  downstairs of  sulpicios house later that morning by margarito and gumercindo cabizares after sulpicio had fired at rafael rotor got the pistol from appellant libumfacil and fired also at rafaelthis appellant was also seen by romualdo ursula and segundino cabizares as among those who arrived at demetrios housewhen ursula cabizares alighted from the house she saw rotor outside holding a pistol which he gave to libumfacil commenting that it was stuckafter the killing of the decedents romualdo cabizares saw him with the group following the cadaver of casiano cabizares which was being brought near sulpicios burned houseappellant bautista claims that on february 2 1958 he left barrio cebuano for tupi  5 kms away  to get a truck to load his corn that afternoon he returned to cebuano where they loaded corn but he could not return to tupi as the truck would not start so he slept at home early the next day february 3 1958 they pushed the truck to start it later appellant matchoca arrived and helped them he also rode in the truck but upon reaching an uphill road it stopped again they were able to recharge its batteries from a tractor that happened to pass by they continued the trip and finally arrived in the poblacion of tupi at about 800 am several months later while he was at sergio rotors house his child told him that a pc soldier was waiting at home so instead of going home he had a conference with andres abapo ramon alquizar roberto matchoca  son of severino  and agapito avellana they all decided to proceed to tupi and surrender to the mayor appellant matchoca related the same incident told by bautista regarding the trip to tupi he then claimed to have returned to barrio cebuano about noontime and there learned of the incident the next day he evacuated his family to avoid trouble the prosecution however has established that these two appellants were in the meeting held in abapos house on february 2 1958 they openly participated therein their meeting with appellant rotor early the following morning has also been established thru the testimony of maximo ca these two were also seen outside sulpicios house bautista was carrying a bolo and a cane and was heard shouting at rafael thus   rafael you cannot reach the trial because we will kill you  gumercindo cabizares also heard matchoca shouting   go ahead shoot we will kill him so that he will not reach the day of the hearing  bautista and matchoca were among those who went to demetrios housethe former thrust his bolo thru the bamboo wallings hitting segundino cabizareswhen ursula cabizares came down from the house she saw bautista holding a boloromualdo on the other hand claimed having seen him holding a firearmafter the killings had taken place bautista went with the group that proceeded back to sulpicios burned house whereas matchoca marched with the other group headed for rafaels house  
homicide, the records show that on december 31 1993 at about 900 pm teresita navarro together with her husband florencio navarro and their two daughters were on their way to church to attend the new years eve mass coming from their house they passed through a twometer wide muddy path between ramie plants in lasang poblacion davao del nortethe ramie plants were thickly planted and reached up to the shoulders of a grown manflorencio walked about twenty meters behind his daughters while teresita was about four meters behind him although it was a moonlit night teresita held a torch to light her way all of a sudden florencio heard a gunshot from behind he immediately looked back and saw his wife lying on the ground the torch she was holding fell but continued to burn with the light coming from the moon and the torch florencio saw the accused albacin approaching him coming from where his wife was he recognized albacin because he personally knew him as his neighbor for more than twenty yearsthen another man wearing a big hat emerged from the ramie plants and approached florencio on his right side at a distance of about half a meter at the right front side of florencio albacin pointed a gun at florencios forehead albacin then fired his gun twice the first shot hitting florencio on his right back hand and the second shot grazing the middle portion of his chest the other man then fired at florencios right waist but his pistol jammedflorencio fled from the crime scene and caught up with his daughters and told them that their mother had been shot and was feared to be dead together they headed to the lasang police substationwhen they got there florencio told the police that he was shot twice but did not reveal the identity of his assailant because he was not in his right mind he asked for help for him to be brought to the hospitalflorencio along with one of his daughters carmela were brought to the davao medical centerhis other daughter went home po paul quilisado the desk officer at the substation entered the report in the police blotter another daughter of florencio teresa sabac got wind of the shooting incident and also arrived at the substation from there she called up her younger brother who later arrived at the substation and was interviewed by the policemen about the name and age of florencio teresa along with a policeman named rufino dayag went to her father in the hospitalanother policeman po2 rodel estrellan called up the bunawan police station for assistance spo1 san nicolas palado received the call and entered in the blotter the shooting of florencio and teresita navarro palado then informed their station commander about the incident and immediately the commander inspector anoos two other policemen and a cafgu member from the bunawan police station went to the lasang substationand together with po2 estrellan proceeded to the crime scenethe police team found the lifeless body of teresita navarro on a private road lying on her side with her face neck chest and clothes burned a lighted torch standing one meter from the feet of the body clearly lighted itthe body was then brought to the house of teresitas inlaws who lived nearbyat about 1000 pm the team of policemen returned to the lasang substation and entered in the police blotter the identity of the victimsat 100 am january 1 1994 the team from bunawan police station returned theremeanwhile florencio was treated by dr alden bagarra a resident surgeon at the davao medical center he sustained a nonpenetrating grazing gunshot wound on the anterior chest and a penetrating gunshot wound on the space between the thumb and the index finger of his right hand both wounds were not seriousdr bagarra testified that if the wound on the right hand was left untreated infection would probably set in in 48 hours and eventually cause general infection leading to death but he also testified that even a small cut if left unattended could cause infection eventually leading to death if left without medical attentionin the medical certificate that dr bagarra prepared he indicated that the probable healing time of the wounds was fifteen days barring complicationfrom the location of the wounds dr bagarra concluded that the assailant was probably on florencios side at a distance of more than two feetat the hospital the police asked florencio about the shooting incident again he did not tell the police who the assailant was because he was still not in his right mindat about 1000 the following morning florencio was discharged from the hospital he then went to his fatherinlaws house for the wake of his wifeduring the wake florencio refused to reveal the identity of the assailant and told teresa that he would avenge the death of teresita on january 2 1994 however he told teresa that the accused albacin was the culprit teresa dissuaded her father from taking revenge and prevailed upon him to file a case instead on january 3 1994 florencio with teresa went to the police station to report that it was the accused albacin who killed his wife and shot him twicehis report was entered by inspector anoos in the police blotter he executed an affidavit narrating the shooting incidentabout a week thereafter before his wife was buried florencio also reported to barangay captain git navarro that it was the accused albacin who shot him twiceafter his wife was buried florencio revealed to his motherinlaw that albacin shot his wifeflorencio testified that prior to the shooting incident the family of the accused albacin already held a grudge against the navarro family the albacins suspected that the accuseds brother was killed by the new peoples army  npa  upon instruction of the navarro family because after the killing the npas

testified that lasang is the last barangay of davao city its boundary is panabo between lasang and cacao a barangay in panabo there are two barangays from lasang cacao can be reached via the national highway alternatively a barangay road where jeeps trucks and motorcycles pass may be taken the distance between these two barangays via the barangay road is about eight kilometersflorencio navarro was recalled on rebuttal he testified that when he would buy pigs he would always traverse by foot the distance between lasang poblacion to the 75th infantry batallion camp in cacao walking at a slow pace it would take him one hour to cover the distance of only six kilometers because the camp is at the edge of barangay katipunan which is only five kilometers away from lasang barangay katipunan is adjacent to barangay cacao the distance of eight kilometers from lasang to cacao on the other hand refers to the center of cacao he reiterated that the accused albacin shot both his wife and himself  florencio the accused was the only person florencio saw with his fallen wife immediately after he heard a gunshot from where his wife was with the light coming from the moon and teresitas torch florencio was able to recognize the accused albacin who has been his neighbor for more than twenty years he testified as follows   q while walking in that position your daughter ahead of you 20 meters and your wife 4 meters  sic  you said you heard a gunshot a yes sir i heard a gunshot q what was your reaction when you heard that gunshot a i looked at my  sic  back and saw my wife already fell down q what else did you see aside from see  sic  your wife already fell down a what i saw was the same person  sic  and he approached me q how many persons did you see aside from your wife a only one later on there was another one who approached me q you said a person when you turned your back and saw your wife fell down you saw a person was approaching you who is that person who approached you a i do not know sir he was wearing a hat q earlier you pointed to the accused what did the accused do after your wife fell a that is why after that he approached me and pointed a gun at me court q when you saw the accused you saw the accused approaching you where did he come from a from the place where my wife fell down   emphasis supplied  dr ledesma the medicolegal expert who examined teresitas body testified that teresita probably died of the gunshot wound she sustained on her head he also concluded that she was shot from within two feet albacin carried a gun with which he shot florencio these circumstances lead us to no other conclusion than that the accused albacin fatally shot teresita direct evidence ie an eyewitness account of the commission of the crime is not always necessary to identify the accused as the perpetrator of the crime a witness may not have actually seen the very act of commission of a crime but he may nevertheless identify the accused as the assailant as when the latter is the person or one of the persons last seen with the victim immediately before and right after the commission of the crimesustain the conviction of an accused through circumstantial evidence the rules on evidence and jurisprudence require that  1  there must be more than one circumstance;  2  the inference must be based on proven facts; and  3  the combination of all circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accusedcontrary to accused albacins allegation the threeday delay in florencios identification of the accused albacin as the assailant does not erode his credibility we have previously ruled that delay in revealing the author of the crime does not impair the credibility of witnesses more so if such delay is satisfactorily explainedflorencio admitted that initially he was not able to reveal the identity of the assailant because he was not in his right mind immediately after the shooting incident a few days after the dastardly act was committed he refused to reveal the identity of the perpetrator of the crimes because he wanted to take revenge against the accused albacin it was only upon insistence of his daughter teresa that he was prevailed upon to report to the authorities the identity of the assailant and accordingly file a case against him

homicide, accusedappellant is now before us urging reversal on the ground that the trial court erred in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt and in finding that treachery attended the commission of the offense a review of the evidence shows that the following statement of the facts of the case made by solicitor general raul i goco assistant solicitor general edgardo l kilayco and associate solicitor elinor o lagunilla is in accord with the evidence on march 1 1992 at around one oclock in the afternoon alvin capistrano then a 14year old boy was inside their house at no 2 jeffrey street gabriel subdivision hulong duhat malabon metro manila with his mother violeta and his sister agnes  p 3 tsn october 20 1993  accusedappellant suddenly arrived holding a gun and shouting   nasaan ang asawa ko    pp 46 tsn ibid;

and  b  the means method or manner of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted by the offender  people vs mendoza 236 scra 666  it must be recalled that accusedappellant barged into the victims house holding a gun and shouting   nasaan ang asawa ko   not finding his wife accusedappellant started making trouble by throwing things around which prompted alvin to fetch his father who was then at a nearby baptismal party in order to pacify accusedappellant on their way home alvin and his father met accusedappellant who suddenly poked a gun on alvins forehead and then turned and shot the victim twice there is no showing that the shooting was premeditated or that accusedappellant in shooting the victim employed means methods or forms to ensure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended victim might make likewise the mere fact that the shooting was sudden the same does not per se bespeak of the circumstance of treachery in the absence of any proof that the means methods or forms were deliberately or consciously adopted by the offender  people vs decena 235 67  and to be sure the victim was not totally unaware of danger for precisely his son called for the victim because accusedappellant was brandishing a gun and making trouble

murder,it is not disputed that on july 28 1960 at about 730 pm the body of pastor ladesa was found in a coffee grove about 200 to 300 meters from his house in balabag astorga municipality of sta cruz davao with several incise wounds on the head which must have caused his death at about 200 pm due to cerebral concussion and cerebral hemorrhage as well as internal and external hemorrhage the only question for determination in this case is who killed him appellant sixto comigjod is married to juliana calungsod daughter of ana albano the latter is in turn ladesas commonlaw wife hence the witnesses herein refer to ladesa as appellants fatherinlaw early in the morning july 29 1960 juliana informed vicebarrio lieutenant victorino andres that ladesas killer is her husband appellant herein soon thereafter that same morning andres transmitted the information to policemen frank bumpus and modesto alama who had come to investigate the occurrence thereafter the policemen proceeded to the scene of the occurrence where appellant was bumpus asked him whether it was he who killed ladesa but appellant did not reply when policeman alama confronted him with the report given by his wife to andres appellant admitted being the killer queried about the instrument used to commit the offense comigjod answered that it was a bolo he had in his house forthwith the policemen accompanied him thereto where comigjod turned over to them the bolo exhibit d which was still stained with blood brought to the police station appellant was further investigated by bumpus to whom the former confessed that he had killed ladesa because he had been too harsh at him thereupon bumpus typewrote the statement exhibit e which appellant thumbmarked and swore to on july 30 1960 before the justice of the peace of sta cruz artemio cometa appellant testified that on july 28 1960 he was with his wife in the house of the aforementioned victorino andres from 1100 am to 400 pm; that when the policemen asked him at the scene of the occurrence why he had killed ladesa he  appellant  denied having done so; that the bolo exhibit d was taken from his house by the policemen not delivered by him to them; that he thumbmarked the statement exhibit e without knowing its contents because the policemen assured him that after affixing his thumbmark thereon they would release him; and that instead however they took him back to his cell where later in the evening they boxed him on the stomach and kicked him on the forehead needless to say the policemen denied having used the alleged duress indeed the same was obviously unnecessary because it was resorted to according to appellant after he had thumbmarked the statement exhibit e moreover the justice of the peace affirmed positively that he had caused the contents of the statement to be translated in his presence to appellant herein into the visayan dialect; that he checked whether the translation was accurate or not; that he  cometa  even inquired from appellant whether the translation into english contained in the statement was likewise accurate; and that appellant answered in the affirmative again nobody ever saw any external sign of appellants alleged maltreatment or was even informed by him about it it seems only too obvious that appellants testimony cannot prevail over that of the justice of the peace upon the other hand appellants alibi was contradicted by victorino andres who declared that appellant went to his  andres  house at 400 pm and was not accordingly there at 200 pm when the crime charged was committed what is more appellant did not introduce the testimony of his wife who according to the theory of the defense was with him when they allegedly went to said house at 1100 am and stayed there continuously up to 400 pm and the reason seems obvious for had she testified for the defense she would have been crossexamined on the fact that it was she who revealed to andres early in the morning on july 29 1960 that the murderer was her husband this was impliedly confirmed by appellant himself he having admitted on the witness stand that while at the scene of the occurrence the policemen asked him why he had killed ladesa it will be recalled in this connection that before proceeding to said place the peace officers had passed by the house of andres who conveyed to them the information given to him by appellants wife 
murder, the prosecution relying mainly on the testimonies of two eyewitnesses  vidal masong and ahenor pagasihan and that of dr megdonio bacal attending physician established the following at about 300 pm on august 1 1959 in barrio taytay municipality of el salvador misamis oriental appellant labis with a bolo chased the deceased clarito fabria near the national highway when the latter happened to pass by a coconut tree appellant cabiles who was standing there grabbed him and locked his arms around the shoulders of clarito fabria with cabiles chest pressing against the right shoulder of clarito this enabled labis to overtake clarito fabria and thereupon the former stabbed the latter with the bolo at his back appellant cabiles then released the deceased who badly wounded tried to run further towards his fathers house later clarito fabria was brought for treatment to the provincial hospital at cagayan de oro city where he died two hours later the attending physician dr bacal found an opening stab wound about three inches long at the back lumbar region middle which deviated laterally to the left and causing an exit wound of one inch in front at the left iliac region  lower abdomen dr bacal also testified that the two wounds could have been caused by a bolo and that the decedents death was due to profuse internal hemorrhage resulting from multiple perforation of the sigmoid and mysentery of the intestine organs usually found on the left of the abdominal cavity the defense narrated the events differently according to appellants labis and cabiles and three of their alleged eyewitness what transpired was this on the morning of august 1 1959 labis and cabiles with several of their barriomates attended a community group work locally known as   pahina   at the public school compound about noontime they all proceeded to the wedding party at pedro estradas house where the deceased and the latters brotherinlaw raul espejon were also present lunch over the group left the place together at the invitation of the decedent and espejon on the way home the two walked ahead while labis cabiles and the rest followed about 20 meters behind as the decedent fabria and espejon neared the national highway the latter stopped near a coconut tree as appellant labis approached espejon confronted him with a bolo asking whether he had a grudge against clarito fabria labis answered that they ought not fight as they were brothers sensing trouble francisco labis a third degree cousin of mauricio labis intervened and advised the two not to fight raul espejon then repaired towards the nearby house of dionisio gaid and labis with the others went their way at this moment clarito fabria brandishing a bolo came running towards them and asked labis of the latter had any grudges against him labis retreated with upraised hands and endeavoured to pacify the deceased by calling him brother and pleading that they should not fight clarito answered by slashing his bolo at labis who in trying to parry the blow was wounded on his left wrist labis retreated further but raul espejon reappeared on the scene and bolo labis at the nape wounding him also appellant labis then turned to face espejon when clarito fabria hurled his bolo at him with the handleend thereof hitting labis on the breast the decedent now bent down to pick up the bolo which fell by labis left side but the latter immediately warded off claritos hands this caused the decedent to turn halfway to his right exposing his left flank to labis instantly labis drew his own bolo from the waist and thrust it at the decedents back at the left side of the lumbar region on the level of the pelvis clarito fabria then ran away wounded towards dionisio gaids house a few moments later policeman maximo gallego who had fired several shots upwards while still at a distance arrived at the scene of the incident and labis surrendered to him the bolo  exh c also marked as exh 12  he used in stabbing clarito fabria and also the bolo  exh 14  which the latter allegedly hurled at him policeman gallego placed labis and cabiles under custody and then went after raul espejon in the house of hugo fabria and got rauls bolo still later gregorio salas the chief of police of el salvador arrived and brought appellants labis and cabiles to the municipal building for investigation appellant cabiles denied having held the decedent clarito fabria as testified to by the prosecution witnesses he claimed that when the deceased confronted labis with a drawn bolo he  cabiles  and francisco labis stood between the protagonists and tried to pacify them and prevent a fight however when clarito fabria threw his bolo at labis cabiles retreated about four meters away since he was afraid that clarito carried a dagger also which he might use at first blush the theory advanced by the defense would seem foolproof but a closer examination of the same reveals weaknesses that cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny the defense witnesses either close friends or relatives of the accused gave evidently wellrehearsed testimonies likely to mislead the gullible and unsuspecting person however a careful evaluation of their version of the incident would show its inconsistency with the natural course of events and human conduct for instance their claim that the accused mauricio labis delivered the fatal blow at the back of clarito labis while they were embracing each other and as the latter was about to pick up his bolo from the ground is not borne out by the position and direction of the wounds of said victim their observations do not also coincide because one declared that mauricio labis pushed aside clarito fabria instead of embraced him as two others testified some even asserted that clarito fabria was hit on the left side of his back which is not true the finding of dr megdonio bacal the examining physician at the provincial hospital of misamis oriental located the entrance wound of about 3 inches in length at the back of clarito fabria across the lower portion of his spinal column and the injury deflected laterally towards his left front side below the waistline causing an exit wound of about an inch in length  exhs b

homicide, the prosecution evidence tends to show the following at around 1030 pm on november 3 1980 accusedappellants and p/sgt somera arrived at the vigan police station at the vigan municipal hall in a police patrol tricycle driven by p/sgt somera they had come from caoayan ilocos sur where they had been asked to help maintain peace and order during the town fiesta upon arrival at the municipal hall p/sgt somera went inside the police station to report to cpl reynaldo gascon oic of the vigan police station while accusedappellants waited for him outside afterwards somera and his companions left for their station in sta catalina not long after the three had left between 1100 and 1130 of that night cpl gascon received a call regarding a shooting at solid west vigan cpl gascon immediately sent pat sumagit to solid west vigan but the latter returned shortly as he could not find any trace of the incident just then however a barangay tanod and a companion came to report that there was really a shooting and took cpl gascon and four other policemen to the scene of the crime as it turned out the other person with the barangay tanod was jovito alibin who is accusedappellant julian rapanuts brotherinlaw cpl gascon and his men saw p/sgt somera slumped over the drivers seat of the tricycle and found empty shells and a 38 cal revolver on the ground when someras body was lifted his gun a 38 cal revolver fell to the ground on the basis of information given to him lt henry thomas commanding officer of the 148th pc command looked for the accusedappellants he went to pat diosdado rapanuts house where he found him sleeping diosdado accompanied lt thomas to julians house but the latter was not there the following day lt thomas was called by then mayor porfirio rapanut  now counsel for the accusedappellants  who took him to a certain place where julian was staying apparently julian had asked mayor porfirio rapanut to facilitate his surrender to the authorities dr elvigio taay the one who conducted the autopsy filed this autopsy report  external findings 1 gunshot wound non penetrating entrance 1 cm in diameter right side of neck middle portion 25 cm below right ear

penetrating wound of esophagus cause of death hemorrhage secondary to gunshot wounds multiple julita tumbaga forensic chemist of the nbi testified on the paraffin test conducted on the hands of the accusedappellants she testified that julian rapanuts right hand tested positive for nitrates which she said possibly came from gun powder residue while diosdado rapanuts hands tested negative she added however that she could not conclude from this circumstance alone that diosdado rapanut did not fire a gun at the time doroteo magaro officerincharge of ballistics of the pc crime laboratory of camp crame testified that a ballistics examination conducted on the shells recovered from the scene of the crime and the test shells as well as the slug recovered from the body of somera and the test bullets show that the shells came from the 556 m16 armalite rifle carried by julian rapanut during the incident and from the 38 cal revolver serial no 658737 issued to him magaro also testified that the test slug and the slug recovered from someras body were fired from the same 38 cal revolver of julian rapanut a fragment was recovered but had no significant bore impressions and it could not be determined from what gun it was fired according to him maximo manuel testified that on november 3 1980 around 1100 pm while he was on his way home after watching a movie he heard gun reports coming from behind him he then dropped to the ground and slowly crawled on his belly back to the place of the incident he stayed low about 15 meters away from the incident to avoid detection he saw accusedappellant julian rapanut standing two meters in front of somera who was then slumped over the drivers seat of the tricycle pointing a long firearm at somera while accusedappellant diosdado rapanut was standing two meters behind somera holding a short gun pointed at the back of somera he said that he did not immediately give a statement to the police and only did so on november 5 1980 presumably because he was afraid to get involved in the case but later he became   uneasy   so he decided to come out with his statement during his cross examination maximo manuel reiterated what he said in his statement he said that julian rapanut was directly in front of somera while diosdado rapanut was positioned obliquely behind somera and that after the incident diosdado rapanut threw the short firearm he was holding to his side and ran away from the scene while julian rapanut stayed manuel admitted that he did not actually see the shooting and that he only heard gun reports cpl reynaldo gascon testified that when somera dropped by his office at around 1030 pm after coming from caoayan he accompanied somera out of the municipal building gascon saw diosdado rapanut and julian rapanut in the police patrol tricycle julian rapanut had an m16 armalite rifle while diosdado rapunat had a 38 cal revolver tucked in his right waist somera then drove the tricycle with diosdado seated behind him and julian seated inside the sidecar the defense claimed that julian rapanut shot amado somera after the latter had drawn his revolver during an altercation while denying that diosdado rapanut ever took part in the killing of somera testifying on his behalf diosdado rapanut said he was not armed on november 3 1980 as he had previously been suspended for ten days  from november 1 to 10 1980  he claimed that he had surrendered the gun issued for the duration of his suspension however he said that on the night in question when somera saw him somera asked him to go with them to caoayan and later to take him  somera  home to solid west by driving the vehicle because there was no other one who knew how to drive with them was the other accusedappellant julian rapanut who was asked by somera to bring along an m16 armalite rifle which was then in the police armory diosdado testified that in addition julian carried a 38 cal revolver the three left for vigan at around 700 pm in a police patrol tricycle with somera driving diosdado sat behind the driver while julian was in the sidecar diosdado said that they stopped by the vigan police station and afterwards proceeded to the caoayan municipal building where they stayed for an hour after which they left for baggoc with somera still driving at baggoc somera looked for remigio polanco but did not find him and was then invited to drink after fifteen  15  minutes they returned to the vigan police station then they left to return to their station in sta catalina but on the way somera decided to stop by a wake at cabittaogan for this purpose he asked julian if he could borrow money from julians sister marcelita alibin which he would donate to the family of the deceased they therefore stopped by marcelita alibins house but julian was given only p5000 by his sister somera thought that the amount was too small and wanted julian to borrow p50000 when julian declined to do so somera got angry and started cursing him    iyot ni inam    and the two had an altercation somera stopped the tricycle drew his gun with his left hand and pointed it at julian who tapped it aside diosdado claims that he got scared and so he got off the tricycle and ran away while he was running away he heard gunshots he allegedly went to marcelita alibins house and told her that julian and somera were shooting each other marcelitas husband jovito alibin reported the matter to the barangay captain accusedappellant julian rapanut admitted having shot somera but claims that he acted in selfdefense he corroborates diosdados claim that the latter was unarmed and ran away when the shooting took place julian said that he was the one who carried the 38 cal revolver in a holster which he claimed got hooked to the armrest of the sidecar as he was stepping out and fell to the ground this explains why the gun was found on the ground at the side of the sidecar first the evidence in this case quite clearly shows both accusedappellants to be guilty of killing somera on november 3 1980 although there is no evidence that diosdado rapanut and the other accusedappellant julian rapanut are related there is no question that the two were with amado somera on the night of november 3 1980 diosdado claims however that he fled from the scene of the crime before the actual shooting because he got frightened when he saw somera and julian drawing their guns in support of his allegation he relies on the testimonies of julian rapanut and segundino pagada jr pagada testified that while he and a friend were walking along burgos st a police patrol tricycle bearing somera julian rapanut and diosdado rapanut passed them by he heard   loud conversation   between two of the men in the tricycle and as the tricycle stopped he saw diosdado alight and run away less than two minutes later pagada and his friend heard gunshots pagada said however that the tricycle and the remaining passenger were not visible to him then   the evidence for the prosecution belies this claim of the defense maximo manuel the eyewitness testified that he saw the two accusedappellants with firearms drawn and pointed at the body of the fallen somera right after he heard gunshots his testimony is corroborated by cpl gascon who testified that when somera and the accusedappellants dropped by his office he saw diosdado rapanut with a gun tucked in his waist it is on the basis of these testimonies that the trial court found diosdado liable the rule is settled that the findings of fact of trial courts which had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses is entitled to great weight in the absence of anything showing bias partiality or grave abuse of discretion indeed the location and the number of the gunshot wounds sustained by the victim indicate that there was more than one gunman and confirm the testimony of maximo manuel regarding the positions of the accusedappellants in relation to the deceased of the six  6  gunshot wounds suffered by the victim two were located on the back of somera and one on the right side of his neck the location of these wounds belies the claim of accusedappellant julian rapanut that he alone had shot somera and that he did so while he was standing in front of him it was highly improbable for julian to have caused those wounds unless he went around his victim as he riddled him with bullets more importantly the ballistics examination also shows that the shells found in the vicinity came from the 556 m16 armalite rifle as well as from the 38 cal revolver the slug recovered from the body of somera also matched the test slug of the same 38 cal revolver it is clear that both the m16 armalite rifle and the 38 cal revolver were used in shooting somera if as julian rapanut said he only used the m16 armalite rifle it stands to reason that another person must have used the revolver in shooting the victim the evidence shows that while this 38 cal revolver had been issued to julian rapanut on the night in question diosdado rapanut was seen with a gun tucked in his waist band the probability therefore is that the gun he had that night was julians gun and that the latter gave his gun to diosdado because julian was already carrying an m16 armalite rifle while diosdado whose own gun had been surrendered for the period of his suspension had none in fact accusedappellants have not explained who could have fired the 38 cal revolver if according to julian rapanuts testimony he only fired the m16 armalite rifle as his 38 cal revolver allegedly fell from his holster while he was getting off from the sidecar these circumstances persuade us that diosdado rapanut was the one who used the 38 cal to shoot somera it is true that the paraffin test showed that diosdado rapanuts hands were negative for nitrates but the nbi forensic chemist said that she could not tell from this circumstance alone that diosdado rapanut did not fire a gun on the other hand julian rapanut admitted shooting somera he claims however that he acted in self defense having made this admission the burden rests upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence the existence of the essential requisites of selfdefense for this purpose he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution more specifically he must prove  1  unlawful aggression;  2  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and  3  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself foremost of these is the requisite that the victim was guilty of unlawful aggression; the absence of this requisite negates the existence of selfdefense it must be positively shown that there was a previous unlawful and unprovoked attack on the person of the defendant which placed him in danger forcing him to repel the attack and to inflict more or less severe wounds upon his assailant by employing reasonable means to resist the same put in another way unlawful aggression connotes a sudden unprovoked attack against the person defending himself there must be a real threat to the life safety or rights of the person attacked and the peril must be imminent or actual there must be an actual sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof and not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude the testimony of diosdado rapanut fails to show that there was unlawful aggression in this case or that even if there was it did not cease to exist before julian rapanut shot somera diosdado rapanut said q and after the late amado somera had stopped the tricycle in that particular place what transpired next if any a the late amado somera was in the act of drawing his gun q when the late amado somera was in the act of pulling out his firearm what did this julian rapanut do a he tapped the gun of amado somera and it was dropped and julian rapanut went down from the tricycle xxx xxx xxx q now you knew that amado somera drew his gun because you were still behind amado somera a yes sir q and you knew that julian rapanut tapped the gun because you were still behind amado somera and julian rapanut was still inside the sidecar a yes sir q you did not try to stop julian rapanut a no sir q you did not try to stop amado somera a no sir q now when julian rapanut stepped down the tricycle you did not stop amado somera a no sir q when julian rapanut stepped down the tricycle you were still behind amado somera a i also alighted from the motorcycle sir q when the service pistol of amado somera was tapped by julian rapanut are you sure that it fell down a yes sir q when you saw it drop you were still behind amado somera a yes sir xxx xxx xxx q now when you said that julian rapanut was inside the sidecar he was to the right of the late amado somera a yes sir q and you are very sure that the late amado somera drew his gun with his left hand a yes sir q how far was julian rapanut to amado somera when amado somera drew the firearm a like this sir  witness pointing to the chair of the interpreter and witness stands indicating a distance of around half foot  q in other words the distance now as you estimated which is your distance from mr colcol was the same distance between amado somera and julian rapanut a yes sir q will you please tap the left hand of mr colcol a  witness tapped the hand of the interpreter  q thats how julian rapanut tapped it a yes sir q now where did the gun fall a i dont know sir where the gun fell but i am sure that the gun fell julian rapanut lost no time trying to overcome this damaging testimony of his coaccused and tried to explain it away by saying that someras gun fell only after he had been shot but between his claim and the testimony of diosdado rapanut the latter appears to be more reliable in the first place if somera dropped his gun because he had been shot it has not been explained why he had to be shot five  5  more times when there was no longer any danger that he would be able to fire his gun in the second place if he dropped his gun only after he had been shot six  6  times it has not been explained why he was not able to fire his gun at all if accusedappellant julian rapanut is to be believed amado somera had drawn his gun first as julian testified q why did he stop the tricycle a because we were already quarreling with each other and then i tapped his gun because he wanted to shoot me and then i jumped out from the tricycle i first shot him because i dont want him that he first shot me but if somera had drawn his gun first how could julian rapanut have gotten out of the sidecar and fire his m16 armalite rifle without being shot moreover the claim of selfdefense is further negated by the location and number of the wounds suffered by the victim if julian rapanuts aim was to simply repel the aggression one shot to disable him without killing him would have been sufficient second we think however that the trial court erred in finding that the killing of amado somera was attended by treachery nobody witnessed the commencement of the attack the prosecution witness maximo manuel said he saw the accusedappellants after the shooting it was precisely because of the gun reports which he heard which attracted his attention circumstances which qualify criminal responsibility cannot rest on mere conjecture no matter how reasonable or probable but must be based on facts of unquestionable existence the rule is that such circumstances must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself therefore as in this case where the lone eyewitness did not see how the attack was carried out and he can not testify on how it began the trial court cannot merely surmise from the circumstances of the case that treachery attended the commission of the crime third lastly we agree with accusedappellants that the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be considered in their favor it has been held that this mitigating circumstance may properly be appreciated if the following requisites concur  1  the offender was not actually arrested;  2  he surrendered himself to a person in authority or to an agent of a person in authority; and  3  his surrender was voluntary as already noted diosdado rapanut voluntarily went with lt henry thomas when the latter went to his house and asked him to go with him while julian rapanut asked then mayor porfirio rapanut to facilitate his surrender and eventually went with lt henry thomas when the mayor brought the latter to

bullets recovered by dr africa from the body of the victim were fired from the same gun he identified the bullets as coming from a 38 caliber gunromeo reyes the brother of the victim alexander reyes testified that he personally knew antonio templo inasmuch as he was his childhood friend together with police officers he searched for the whereabouts of templo after the shooting incident they searched for templo in bataan and mindoro before they learned that he had fled to stay with his sister in the united states of americaon july 8 1992 the us authorities arrested templo for being an illegal alien at his sisters office in queens new york roosevelt avenue us templo denied the charge alleging that his name was richard barba when romeo reyes called templo by his nickname   tony   the latter looked at him and then remembered him inside his prison cell at the us immigration office templo approached romeo reyes and asked for forgivenesstemplo was eventually deported to the philippines on june 2 1993for his defense antonio templo testified that in the afternoon of september 11 1988 he drove her 13 year old daughter maria antoinette templo to the place of a certain mr vega who would type her daughters term paper upon reaching the corner of solis and katigbak streets his jeep was stopped by alexander reyes and then berated him   putang ina mo bakit ganyan   with a 38 caliber revolver reyes pistol whipped templo on the left side of his nape reyes told him to alight from his jeep after he alighted templos first reaction was to leave his daughter he ran to the crowd but suddenly stopped upon hearing two  2  gunshots reyes was not there anymore when templo went back he then drove the jeep to the place of mr vega he only found out from his brotherinlaw ramon ternate sr that alexander reyes was shot deadappellant denied challenging alexander reyes to a fight because according to him it would not look good in the presence of his daughtertemplo surmised that reyes pistolwhipped him because he did not pay the five thousand  p500000  peso membership fee in the gun club of the deceased he claimed that reyes had many enemies for the reason that he was a mischievous    pilyo    person for example he killed a helper of one rene gloria for disclosing his illegal activities he also had a rift with the del rio family two  2  of whose members were killedtemplo left the philippines together with his family to avoid the members of the new peoples army who used to visit his farm in batangashe denied any knowledge that a warrant of arrest was issued against him before he left the philippineshe denied having asked for forgiveness from romeo reyes after his arrest in new york for being an illegal alien during the deportation proceedings he filed an application for political asylum but it was deniedprosecution witnesses constantino and abogade positively identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime it was only about 530 oclock in the afternoon when they saw appellant shot the victim twice on the chest appellant followed the victim as the latter attempted to flee and in the process he  appellant  got close to prosecution witness constantino who was standing at the opposite side of the intersection where the shooting incident occurred this prosecution witness who positively identified appellant as the assailant of the victim did not waiver on crossexamination on the other hand appellants defense is a mere alibi he claims that before the gunshots were fired he left the crime scene and hid behind a jeep when he heard two  2  gunshots he went back to look for his daughter he denied shooting reyes for the reason that according to him he was not carrying a gun he even shifted the blame on reyes as the one who allegedly whipped him in the nape with a 38 caliber pistol when he returned to the place of shooting reyes was not there anymore so he drove his jeep to mr vegas place alibi is inherently weak for it is easy to contrive and concoct for such defense to prosper it is not enough for the accused to prove that he was somewhere else when the crime occurred he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crimein the case at bar it was established that appellant was just a few meters away from the crime scene it was not physically impossible for him to have committed the crime besides it is a wellsettled rule that when there are credible witnesses such as in the case at bench who have positively identified the assailant the defense of alibi is negative and selfserving and deserves no probative weightappellant contends that the affidavit of prosecution witness jovita constantino was taken twentytwo  22  days after the shooting incident occurred her account according to appellant was an afterthought to plug the gaps in the prosecution witness statements of john marfilla and anicia abogade appellant also contends that the testimony of jovita constantino was laden with inconsistencies he points out that constantino allegedly stayed in the factory up to 800 oclock in the afternoon while abogade testified that she was with constantino between 700 up to 800 oclock in the evening appellant also points out that constantino earlier denied knowing appellants name at the time of the shooting incident but later on admitted to have heard from her coworkers the appellants name as the one responsible for the crime these are minor inconsistencies that cannot override the prosecution witnesses positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime although there may be inconsistencies on minor details in her testimony the same do not impair constantinos credibility as a witness minor variances in the details of a witness account more frequently than not are badges of truth rather than indicia of falsehood and they often bolster the probative value of the testimonyappellant further contends that constantino and abogade are relatives and that they share the same middle name that is   amande   being relatives it was probable that they have compared notes apart from being a mere conclusion of fact on the part of appellant relationship assuming there is one will not by itself undermine the credibility of the said prosecution witnesses without showing improper motive for testifying against the appellant the absence of evidence showing any improper motive on the part of the said principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive exists and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credence

hospital later that evening jacobe learned that zandro was found dead in a kangkong field near the davao visayan village the other prosecution witness wilbert vargas is the brother of the deceased wilbert testified that at 600 pm on july 9 1988 while he was talking to a friend on roxas street near the public market he was told that his brother zandro was being beaten up in a carinderia at the corner of roxas and sobrecary streets wilbert immediately proceeded to the j spot carinderia he saw accusedappellant aiming his gun at zandro as the latter was running away accusedappellant shot

his brother loaded onto the tricycle   like a pig   with zandros feet hanging out wilbert tried to come to the aid of his brother but accusedappellant pointed his gun at him causing him to run home in fear wilbert vargas told his parents what had happened to his brother they searched for zandro they went to mangga davao and there learned from jose montilla the driver of the tricycle which accusedappellant sumaoy and his companions hailed that zandro had been killed and that his body had been dumped in a kangkong field in visayan village tagum davao wilbert and his parents proceeded to the place indicated and there found zandros dead body wilbert vargas identified pacifico sumaoy as one of the assailants wilbert testified that he recognized sumaoy because the latter was assigned to

of the 1103rd criminal investigation service  cis  in tagum davao accusedappellant identified a document signed by technical sergeant ricardo go called   duty detail   showing that accusedappellant was on duty from 800 am of july 9 1988 to 800 am of july 10 1988 ricardo go technical sergeant philippine constabulary and team leader of the criminal investigation service command tagum davao and patrolman narciso vismanos corroborated the accusedappellants alibi accusedappellant sumaoy has appealed from this decision of the trial court he contends that the prosecution evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty necessary to support a judgment of conviction he points out that no proof was presented as to the type of weapon used in the shooting of zandro vargas and he challenges the testimony and credibility of witnesses wilbert vargas and patricio jacobe jr on the other hand the solicitor general in representation of the prosecution argues that the circumstances established by the prosecution when taken together constitute an unbroken chain leading to the inevitable conclusion that accusedappellant shot and killed zandro vargas while there is no direct evidence showing that it was indeed accusedappellant who shot zandro in the head the solicitor general claims that the testimonies of wilbert vargas and patricio jacobe that zandro was last seen alive with accusedappellant and three other men clearly prove that no other person could have shot and killed zandro vargas than accusedappellant pacifico sumaoy we agree with the solicitor general that the circumstantial evidence in this case establishes beyond reasonable doubt that accusedappellant shot and killed zandro vargas these circumstances as pointed out by the solicitor general are the following  a  zandro was being mauled by appellant and his companions  p 5 tsn june 28 1990 ;  b  as zandro was attempting to run appellant drew his pistol and shot zandro  pp 56 ibid ;  c  zandro was hit on the arm  p 6 tsn ibid and p 8 tsn july 13 1990 ;  d  zandro fell on his knees  p 6 tsn june 28 1990 ;  e  zandro was dragged towards a motorized pedicab by appellant  p 6 tsn june 28 1990 and p 8 tsn july 13 1990 ;  f  zandro was loaded on the motorized pedicab and appellant and his companions boarded the same pedicab  pp 67 tsn june 28 1990 and pp 810 tsn july 13 1990 ;  g  zandro was found dead  p 11 tsn june 28 1990 together these circumstances constitute an unbroken chain which leads to only one fair and reasonable conclusion  that the accused is guilty of the killing of zandro vargas it was established by positive testimony that accusedappellant sumaoy shot the deceased in the arm and thereafter took the victim with him to an undisclosed location with the help of three other men only the accusedappellant was seen with a firearm less than 24 hours later the victim was found dead not only was accusedappellant identified as the person with whom zandro vargas was last seen alive he was also positively identified as the person who shot zandro vargas in the arm there is thus proof of aggression on the part of the accused which taken with the other circumstances shows he had the intent to inflict injury upon the victim in the case of people v fulinara the accused were convicted of kidnapping with murder based upon positive testimony that the victim was last seen alive when he was forcibly abducted by two armed men in army fatigues who were later identified as the accused after the victim was abducted by the accused he was later found dead as in the case before us there was no eyewitness at the precise moment the victim was killed accusedappellant contends that he cannot be convicted without the presentation of the gun in evidence he alleges that the prosecutions failure to match the slugs recovered from the body of zandro vargas with accusedappellants own firearm precludes his conviction this contention has no merit the presentation and identification of the weapon used are not indispensable to prove the guilt of the accused the time which elapsed from the moment the victim was last seen alive and the moment his body was found narrows the possibility that another agent caused his death especially where an aggression was established against the victim before he disappeared with the accused the accusedappellant tries to discredit the testimonies of the principal prosecution witnesses he point out that patricio jacobe jr testified that zandro was shot in the right arm while wilbert vargas said zandro was shot in the left this is however an inconsistency concerning a minor matter which does not impair credibility of the witnesses the inconsistency negates any suspicion that the testimonies were perjured or rehearsedmoreover findings of fact of trial courts particularly with respect to the credibility of witnesses who personally appeared and testified before them must be respected on appeal accusedappellants defense of alibi is of no moment not only was accusedappellant positively identified as the person who had shot and taken zandro vargas to an undisclosed placed it is also settled that for alibi to prosper it is not enough that accusedappellant prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed he must demonstrate that he could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or in its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission the testimony of accusedappellant t/sgt go and pat narciso vismanos failed to show that it was impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime the cis office was only one kilometer away from the scene of the crime in addition vismanos admitted that he was so absorbed in his work that he did not really know whether accusedappellant was in the office premises the entire day of the latters duty while the evidence in this case sufficiently establishes the guilt of the accusedappellant for the killing of victim zandro vargas we think he cannot be held liable for murder because of the absence of evidence as to the manner of the actual killing where no particulars are known as to the manner in which the aggression was made or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed it cannot be established from mere suppositions that the accused perpetrated the killing with treachery the evidence shows that the aggression against the victim began when he was still at the j spot carinderia as a matter of fact according to patricio jacobe jr the deceased was trying to flee from the accusedappellant when the latter shot him thus indicating that the victim had been forewarned of a greater aggression against him the assault on the victim cannot be said to have been made in a sudden or unexpected manner so as to justify a finding of treachery the trial court also erred in finding the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of official position in the commission of the offense this circumstance requires that the accused as a public officer used the influence or reputation of his position for the purpose of committing the crime if the accused could have perpetrated the crime without occupying his position then there is no abuse of public position in the case before us no evidence was adduced to show that the killing of zandro vargas was in any way facilitated by the accusedappellants public position it was not even shown whether the accusedappellant wore his uniform or used his service firearm when he committed the crime

certain bonifacio daang which was held in the same evening when analou eduave was killed appellant romeo lumandong was among the persons included in the list that was subsequently forwarded to the police the investigation by the police of the said suspects yielded negative result later however barangay captain obsioma received information that appellant lumandong had knowledge about the crime consequently barangay captain obsioma wrote a letter to homer paduga requesting the latter to bring the appellant to his house in the afternoon of december 17 1995 at the appointed time and date homer paduga and appellant lumandong appeared before barangay captain obsioma in his house homer paduga remained at the terrace while the appellant proceeded to the backyard with the barangay captain obsioma asked the appellant what he knew about the killing of analou eduave the appellant initially gave no answer and merely bowed his head after having been asked for the third time appellant admitted the killing of analou eduave allegedly because her parents withheld his past earnings in the farm in addition appellant revealed that it was actually analous father whom he intended to kill but he was not in the house that fateful evening and that he stabbed analou with a double bladed knife only five  5  times the other wounds being mere exit wounds he also said that he did not rape analou and undressed her only to confuse the investigators about the motive for the killing in view of the admissions of the appellant barangay captain obsioma did not allow him anymore to leave his house that evening on the following day obsioma accompanied the appellant to the homicide and arson division of the cagayan de oro police for formal investigation at the police headquarters spo1 agbalog apprised the appellant of his constitutional rights since the appellant had no lawyer agbalog suggested that he would be given a lawyer who could provide him legal services for free to which the appellant agreed thus the legal services of atty emelgar paasa of the public attorneys office  pao  was engaged by the police to assist the appellant during the investigation according to atty paasa the appellant accepted him to act as his counsel during the custodial investigation after having been informed by atty paasa of his rights under the constitution the appellant agreed to give a statement wherein he admitted stabbing analou eduave with a double bladed knife at around midnight of november 30 1995 in the grassy portion of the iponan river in sitio bolihon inasmuch as he harbored a grudge against her parents also in the presence of atty paasa during the same investigation the appellant executed a waiver for his continued detention both documents were acknowledged by the appellant before atty anabel carmen s casino branch clerk of court rtc cagayan de oro city branch 17 appellant lumandong testified that he attended the birthday party of a certain boni daang in the afternoon of november 30 1995 among those who attended the birthday party were homer paduga isagani pabilona wilfredo eduave zaldy eduave and rubio paduga after eating and drinking red horse beer appellant left the party at around 900 oclock in the evening and proceeded to sleep in the house of homer paduga where he had been staying for eight  8  months appellant vehemently denied in court that he killed analou eduave and claimed that he confessed to the crime before the barangay captain and the police for fear of his life he stated that he and homer paduga were fetched on december 17 1995 from the latters house by a barangay tanod upon order of the barangay captain upon reaching the house of the barangay captain the appellant was led to the back portion of the house while homer paduga was instructed to remain at the terrace in front of the house in the presence of six  6  barangay tanods the barangay captain asked the appellant three  3  times if he had anything to do with the killing of analou eduave on november 30 1995 to which he replied in the negative each time apparently losing his patience the barangay captain hit the appellant on the left side of his body with the butt of his shotgun the barangay tanods kicked and mauled the appellant on the different parts of his body thereafter appellant was handcuffed by the barangay captain and the same was attached to a live electric wire which caused the appellant to feel numb and loss consciousness upon recovering his consciousness and while still feeling the pain appellant pleaded for his life as he acceded to admit killing analou eduave that evening appellant stayed in the house of the barangay captain inasmuch as he was not permitted to return home in the early morning of the following day the appellant was brought by the barangay captain and the chief of the tanods to the police headquarters in cagayan de oro city it was po3 agbalog who interrogated him about the killing of analou eduave in the presence of the barangay captain and the chief of the tanods he recalled having confessed his guilt before agbalog due to fear arising from the threat of the barangay captain that he will be killed by the police if he would not admit to the crime atty emelgar paasa arrived only after the interrogation and informed him that he was going to be his counsel appellant denied that he admitted killing the victim before atty paasa and atty casino who appeared to have administered the oath to him inasmuch as they did not talk to him anymore homer paduga was presented by the prosecution as a rebuttal witness he testified that appellant lumandong had been residing in his house for almost eight  8  months before the killing happened on november 30 1995 and that a barangay tanod went to his house on december 17 1995 upon order of the barangay captain to fetch him and the appellant appellant went with the barangay captain inside his house while paduga remained outside about thirty  30  minutes later the barangay captain went out and told paduga that appellant admitted killing analou eduave thereafter the appellant narrated to the barangay captain and homer paduga how he killed the victim and the reason for killing his said victim he denied that appellant was mauled while the said appellant was inside the house of the barangay captain he emphasized that only the appellant and the barangay captain talked during the occasion in addition paduga disclosed that he was the one who turned over to the barangay captain the knife which was allegedly used by the appellant in killing the victim appellant lumandong denied during the trial that he killed analou eduave he alleged that he was maltreated by the barangay officials in the house of barangay captain obsioma in sitio bolihon taglimao cagayan de oro city in the evening of december 17 1995 he also alleged that he confessed before po3 agbalog due to fear arising from the threat from obsioma that the police would kill him should he refuse to admit the crime an extrajudicial confession will be struck for being involuntary if it had been obtained with the use of coercion intimidation inducement or false promises the evidence however fails to support the allegation of the appellant that he was maltreated by the barangay officials in the house of barangay captain obsioma it appears that the appellant was accompanied by his friend homer paduga when he went to the house of barangay captain obsioma in sitio bolihon taglimao cagayan de oro city in the afternoon of december 17 1995 paduga waited for the appellant at the terrace while the latter was conversing with the barangay captain at the backyard after about thirty  30  minutes the barangay captain informed paduga that the appellant admitted to him that he killed analou eduave he then inquired from the appellant himself and the latter confirmed that he was the one who killed analou eduave on november 30 1995 homer paduga categorically denied the allegation of the appellant that he was maltreated by the barangay officials while he was in the house of barangay captain obsioma paduga disclosed that he even remained in the house of barangay captain obsioma the entire evening of december 17 1995 to be with the appellant besides the credibility of the appellant is seriously put to doubt when he failed to divulge during the trial the names of the barangay tanods who allegedly mauled and kicked him despite the fact that he was also a resident of the same village significantly the appellant did not assail the regularity of the custodial investigation that was conducted by the police at the police headquarters in cagayan de oro city on december 18 1995 his bare allegation of threats from the barangay captain is certainly not convincing in view of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary barangay captain obsioma and the chief of the barangay tanods merely accompanied the appellant to the police headquarters in view of the latters previous admission to the killing of analou eduave upon arrival thereat barangay captain obsioma immediately turned over the appellant to the police and informed po3 vladimir agbalog who is the police officer assigned to the case that the appellant wanted to surrender for killing analou eduave before formally starting with the investigation po3 agbalog apprised the appellant of his rights under section 12  1  article iii of the 1987 constitution namely 1  the right to remain silent; 2  the right to have counsel of his own choice; and 3  the right to be informed of said rights the appellant indicated that he had no counsel po3 agbalog then suggested that he would be given a lawyer who could provide him legal assistance for free the appellant agreed po3 agbalog contacted the public attorneys office in cagayan de oro city to request legal assistance for the appellant accordingly the head of the said office atty sofia bacal designated atty emelgar paasa to assist the appellant during the custodial investigation at the police headquarters atty paasa talked to the appellant alone for about one  1  hour inside a room away from the police and the barangay officials during the occasion atty paasa asked the appellant if the latter was willing to accept him as his counsel to which the appellant agreed atty paasa proceeded to explain to the appellant his constitutional rights before inquiring about the incident the appellant revealed that he harbored a grudge against the parents of analou eduave inasmuch as they maltreated him consequently on november 30 1995 at almost midnight the appellant carried analou from her house toward the iponan river where he continuously stabbed her until she died the appellant decided to surrender to the police for the reason that he was bothered by his conscience and that he was also willing to execute a written statement before the police the written statement of appellant lumandong was taken by po3 agbalog in the presence of atty paasa po3 agbalog simultaneously typed the questions and the corresponding answers of the appellant which were both made in the visayan dialect inasmuch as the same was comprehensible to the appellant the truth of the contents of the written statement was affirmed by the appellant before atty annabel carmen s casino branch clerk of court rtc cagayan de oro city branch 17 after the latter also informed the appellant of the consequences of his statement specifically atty casino warned the appellant that he might be convicted for life and that appellant could still retract his statements if the same were not true however the appellant stated that he was bothered by his conscience and then proceeded to sign his written statement thereafter atty emelgar paasa signed the written statement as the assisting counsel of the appellant before atty casino who likewise signed the same in her capacity as administering officer

those of menen gomez and of ireneo talao wherein both stated that they now realize that having been hit first castro merely shot in selfdefense it is our opinion that the lower court rightly disregarded these affidavits while conrada piligomez confirmed her affidavit under oath she admitted having agreed to castros proposal of settlement in consideration of p50000  tsn of nov 11 1958 vergara pp 5758  and menen gomez and ireneo talao admitted in open court that they signed the affidavits upon the request of conrada piligomez who explained that the case was being amicably settled  tsn of nov 11 1958 vergara pp 5161  needless to stress the present criminal cases are not subject to compromise and the opinion of conrada piligomez as to the guilt of the accused is not controlling since she was not a witness to the incident in question

sir q at the wake of whom a jovita maramba sir q at about that time when you were at the wake of jovita maramba do you remember anything unusual that happened if any a there was sir q will you kindly tell this honorable court what [that was] all about a it was an incident that one alan narvasa stabbed a certain mario raguindin sir q do you know that alan narvasa personally a yes sir x x x x x x x x x q this alan narvasa which you have just pointed is he the same accused in this criminal case no d10914 whose name is reynald narvasa a yes sir q immediately before reynaldo narvasa stabbed mario raguindin where were you a right after i bought cigarette i saw reguindin going towards his home and was followed by alan narvasa and thereafter he stabbed sir atty caguioa we move to strike out the answer of the witness being not responsive court q how far were you from the accused when he stabbed raguindin a more or less four meters madam q that was when raguindin was going home from the wake a yes madam court proceed atty sabado [q] this store that you have just stated where you bought this cigarette who is the owner if you know a nora vidal sir q how far is the store from the actual place where alan or reynaldo narvasa stabbed mario raguindin a five to 6 meters sirif it were true that appellant was actually the victim and not the perpetrator in this case it does not make sense for him to wait for more than a month before reporting the incident to the authorities the stabbing took place on april 14 1992 appellant was arrested on april 20 1992 while being treated at the hospitalappellant could have given his statement as early as the time of his arrest if not immediately after the alleged assault upon him to bring to justice those who have allegedly wronged him however appellant remained silent until sometime in may 1992 when he filed charges against david raguindin claiming that it was actually the raguindin brothers who assaulted him and that it was david who mistakenly stabbed his own brother his belated claims do not square with human experience and common sense they now appear as mere selfserving averments the explanation of defense witness rodolfo tamayo that he gave his statement to the police only on may 28 1992 because he waited for appellant to recuperate from his wounds is also not in accord with human nature note that appellant  tamayos nephew  was arrested and jailed only five days after the incident even without his wounds having healed the natural thing to do is to come forward and narrate what one allegedly witnessed as soon as possible to save the innocent from arrest and incarceration since tamayo is appellants uncle tamayo had even more reason than an ordinary witness to report to the police what he saw if indeed he did see that it was appellant being assaulted by the deceased what is apparent to us is that appellant needed time to concoct his version of how the incident happened we agree with the trial court that appellants claim that it was david who stabbed his brother mario was only adopted by appellant belatedly to escape conviction at this stage we could not give credence to the defenses claim that david mistakenly hit mario with a knife thrust allegedly intended for appellant the trial court noted that mario was smaller and bulkier than the taller and leaner appellantand they bore no resemblance with each other thus we find no reason to overrule the finding of the trial court on this score as earlier cited the attack on the deceased mario by appellant was sudden from behind  and fatal appellant has not shown that the prosecution witnesses against him were motivated by ill will so that they would testify falsely against him the trial court is well justified in concluding that they were not ill motivated and their testimony is entitled to fall faith and creditnote that the spot where the stabbing occurred could not be said as poorly lit as to impair visibility on this point david raguindin testified to the contrary q how were you able to see the incident since it is nighttime a there was a light sir q light from where a there are electric light in the houses and also in the post sir  
murder,the facts established conclusively by the evidence are the following at about 1200 oclock noon on december 31 1965 while prosecution witness epifanio cabe was walking along one of the streets of barrio dapdap municipality of las navas north samar and arrived in front of the house of one pablo jazmines he saw appellant holding the now deceased carlos tapong by the neck as the two were apparently wrestling with each other carlito pajenado appellants cousin intervened and the two pajenados were able to throw tapong to the ground carlito pajenado held tapong by the shoulder and pinned him down to the ground while appellant held him by one leg as they thus held carlos tapong helpless appellant drew his gun and fired at him thereupon carlito pajenado stood up and ran away while appellant remained at the scene of the crime with his drawn gun until a policeman another pajenado  ernesto  arrived and took the firearm from him carlos tapong mortally wounded was thereafter carried home by his father and other relatives another prosecution witness pelagia tapong testified that at noon on the day in question while she was at the window of the house of her elder brother angel along the street where the incident took place she saw appellant standing on the street; that when carlos tapong appeared appellant immediately met him and held him by the neck; that thereafter carlito pajenado intervened and with his help appellant was able to fell carlos to the ground it is not denied that carlos tapong died as a result of the gunshot wound inflicted upon him on that occasion testifying on the nature thereof dr angel tan municipal health officer of las navas said that he conducted a post mortem examination of the cadaver on january 1 1966 and found that the deceased sustained three gunshot wounds which in his opinion were caused by a single shot from a 45 caliber pistol the wounds are described by him in his autopsy report exhibits a a1 and a2 as follows gun shot wound with entrance at the posteromedial portion of the distal third of the thigh making an exit at its upper promixmal third in the anterolateral margin making another entrance at the right hypogastric region penetrating the abdominal cavity perforating the intestines penetrating the left dome of the diaphragm to enter the left thoracic cavity dr tan also testified that considering the presence of powder burns in the body of the deceased he must have been shot at a distance of less than one meter and that the cause of his death was shock due to external and internal hemorrhage the testimony of prosecution witness pelagia tapong clearly shows that for sometime before the incident appellant had been waiting for carlos tapong to appear and that as soon as the latter showed up and arrived in front of the house of pablo jazmines appellant met him and held him by the neck; that thereafter his cousin carlito helped him throw their victim to the ground this we believe is sufficient evidence of premeditation

out that it was impossible for them to have seen or properly identified them as the assailants because they could not have been recognized from the distance said witnesses indicated in their testimonies such assertion however dims in the presence of evidence supporting the contrary the trial court perceiving the possible objections on the matter of identification commissioned a geodetic engineer to determine the distance between the observation point of manga and the locus delicti and found that mangas testimony on the matter approximated the finding of the commissioner the prosecutions evidence on the issue of visibility was satisfactory  it was a moonlit night and while the crime was being perpetrated the fluorescent lamp at the store was on while manga was hiding behind plants his testimony that he had an unobstructed view of the crime was unsullied moreover the witnesses were no strangers to all the appellants as they were barriomates in fact appellants sabior moreng and toniacao held responsible positions in the barangay the issue of credibility on appeal is unavailing the judge below is in a better position to pass judgment on the issue because it is he who personally heard the witnesses testify and observed their deportment and manner of testifying thus his evaluation deserves no less than the highest respect of the appellate court in addition to this settled doctrine is the fact that the defense simply failed to offer any piece of evidence attributing to the prosecution witnesses any foul motive to falsely accuse and incriminate the appellants in so grave a crime thus their testimonies deserve full faith and credit criminal conspiracy was deduced by the trial court from the   joint acts of the accused in helping one another to establish conspiracy two or more persons must be shown to come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony it is not however necessary that direct proof be adduced to establish such agreement it can be inferred from the acts of the accused which clearly manifest a concurrence of wills a common intent or design to commit a crime what is essential is that there is unity of purpose and unity in the execution of the unlawful objective to hold an accused guilty as a coprincipal by reason of conspiracy it must be shown that he had performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the conspiracy such an act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself or of moral assistance to his coconspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other coconspirators by moving them to execute or implement the conspiracy once conspiracy has been established all the conspirators become liable as coprincipals regardless of the extent and character of their individual participation in the crime because in contemplation of law the act of one is the act of all the guilt of one is the guilt of all prosecution witness rogelio manga positively testified that he saw appellants in the company of nestor patigue help each other in mauling the victim he saw that luayon used an iron bar  spring leaf ; sabior a bottle of   grande    a oneliter bottle of san miguel beer ; moreng a piece of wood and patigue a bottle of   family    a 769 mi bottle of cocacola  these objects are lethal when used with force upon a person in the case at bar the use of these objects resulted in the instantaneous death of castillon the fact that each of the appellants was armed with these objects shows that indeed they had a common objective in mind  to finish off castillon even after the commission of the offense appellants acted in unison in trying to cover up the crime appellants sabior and luayon led the carabao with the victim on its back towards the cemetery away from the scene of the crime for his part toniacao assisted by fresco elicot cleaned up the place with sand in a bid to hide the traces of the crime against these positive proofs of their culpability each of the appellants interposed simple denial while admitting that they in fact where at the scene of the crime immediately before it was perpetrated such bare denials unsupported as they are by independent evidence are no more than selfserving assertions it is a weak defense and if cannot prevail over the declaration of credible witnesses who were able to positively identify them as the authors of the crime the manner by which the assault commenced was drawn out by toniacaos own counsel atty conrado edig at his clients direct examination without closing such examination however atty edig asked for continuance on account of his own illness the direct examination was supposed to have been concluded the next hearing day october 31 1989 but this scheduled hearing as well as all subsequent hearings were continually postponed when the case was finally heard almost a year later or on october 24 1990 atty edig instead of recalling toniacao to the witness stand presented appellant moreng for direct examination luayon was therefore deprived of the opportunity to confront his coaccused who sadly in his selfish bid for exoneration turned witness against him teenagers eman ayop and ronnie custodio who executed a joint affidavit stating that they saw that appellant luayon after having urinated suddenly run towards the back of castillon and hit his neck with an iron bar could have been utilized as witnesses to bolster proof on the initial assault on the victim however neither the prosecution nor the defense presented them as witnesses while their joint affidavit was offered by the prosecution as exhibit p the same may not suffice to prove the first assault to the prejudice of the defense particularly appellant luayon which was not given the opportunity to confront them and verify the truth of their common statement  
parricide, that on or about september 3 1993 at poblacion municipality of infante province of pangasinan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with evident premeditation and treachery armed with a bladed weapon did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack and stab lilia m madarang his legitimate wife inflicting upon her stab wound 4 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inch es  long and 3/16 of an inch wide located just below the left clavicle 1 3/4 inch es  lateral to the suprasternal notch and plowed along the interpace slightly coursing upward and posteriorly and stab wound 1 inch in length gaping and 3 1/2 inch es  deep located at the right arm at its medial aspect coursing upwards and medially towards the apex of the right axilla which caused her instantaneous death to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of lilia m madarang the initial examination of the accused at the ncmh revealed that he was suffering from a form of psychosis known as schizophrenia the accused was detained at the hospital and was administered medication for his illness on june 19 1996 after more than two  2  years of confinement the accused was discharged from the ncmh and recommitted to the provincial jail as he was already found fit to face the charges against him at the resumption of the hearing a reverse trial was conducted the accused proceeded to adduce evidence on his claim of insanity at the time he committed the offense as culled from the testimonies of the accused his motherinlaw avelina mirador and his daughter lilifer madarang the following facts were established the accused and lilia mirador were legally married and their union was blessed with seven  7  children the accused worked as a seaman for sixteen  16  years he was employed in a united states ship until 1972 in 1973 he worked as a seaman in germany and stayed there for nine  9  years or until 1982 thereafter he returned to his family in infanta pangasinan and started a hardware store business his venture however failed worse he lost his entire fortune due to cockfighting in the latter part of july 1993 the accused his wife lilia and their children were forced to stay in the house of avelina mirador as the accused could no longer support his family moreover lilia was then already heavy with their eight child and was about to give birth on september 3 1993 at about 500 pm the accused and lilia had a squabble the accused was jealous of another man and was accusing lilia of infidelity in the heat of the fight and in the presence of their children the accused stabbed lilia resulting in her untimely demise avelina mirador was then in the pigpen when she heard the children of the accused shouting and crying inside her house she called out to them and asked what was wrong she received no reply her nephew barged into the house and brought out the children one at a time leaving the accused with lilia while passing by avelina her nephew warned her   you better run   avelina then saw the accused emerge from the house holding a bolo she scampered for safety she declared that during the period that the accused and his family stayed in her house she did not notice anything peculiar in accuseds behavior that would suggest that he was suffering from any mental illness neither did she know of any reason why the accused killed his wife as she never saw the two engage in any argument while they were living with her the accused declared that he has absolutely no recollection of the stabbing incident he could not remember where he was on that fateful day he did not know the whereabouts of his wife it was only during one of the hearings when his motherinlaw showed him a picture of his wife in a coffin that he learned about her death he however was not aware of the cause of her demise he claimed that he did not know whether he suffered from any mental illness and did not remember being confined at the ncmh for treatment dr wilson s tibayan a resident doctor of the national center for mental health  ncmh  declared that the accused was committed to the ncmh on july 4 1994 upon order of the court the ncmh conducted three  3  medical and psychiatric evaluations of the accused during his confinement therein based on the first medical report dated august 2 1994 the accused was found to be suffering from insanity or psychosis classified as schizophrenia dr tibayan explained that schizophrenia is a mental abnormality characterized by impaired fundamental reasoning delusions hallucinations preoccupation with ones thoughts poor selfcare insight and judgment and impaired cognitive social and occupational functions the patient may be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong or know what he is doing he may become destructive or have a propensity to attack any one if his hallucinations were violent a schizophrenic however may have lucid intervals during which he may be able to distinguish right from wrong dr tibayan opined that the accuseds mental illness may have begun even prior to his admission to the ncmh and it was highly possible that he was already suffering from schizophrenia prior to his commission of the crime by december 21 1994 as per the second medical report the accused was still suffering from schizophrenia after one and a half years of confinement the third psychiatric evaluation of the accused dated may 27 1996 showed that his mental condition considerably improved due to continuous medication the accused was recommended to be discharged from the ncmh and recommitted to jail to stand trial the appellant insists that at the time he stabbed his wife he was completely deprived of intelligence making his criminal act involuntary his unstable state of mind could allegedly be deduced from the following first he had no recollection of the stabbing incident hence he was completely unaware of his acts that fateful day and must have committed the crime without the least discernment second his behavior at the time of the stabbing proved he was then afflicted with schizophrenia he cited the testimony of dr tibayan that a schizophrenic may go into extremes — he may be violent and destructive or very silent and selffocused the appellant exhibited his violent tendencies on that fateful day he killed his wife and avelina and her nephew were so frightened that they ran away at the sight of him holding a bolo he did not seem to recognize anybody and could have turned to anyone and inflicted further injury he avers that this is peculiar only to persons who are mentally deranged for a sane person who just committed a crime would have appeared remorseful and repentant after realizing that what he did was wrong third the appellant also relies on dr tibayans opinion that there was a high possibility that he was already suffering from insanity prior to his commission of the crime on september 3 1993 the defense posits that his mental illness may have been caused by his loss of fortune his hardware business which he started through 16 years of working as a seaman went bankrupt he ended up virtually dependent on his motherinlaw for his familys support and all these may have been beyond his capacity to handle the appellant further contends that the fact that he and his wife never engaged in a fight prior to that fateful day should be considered the marked change in his behavior when he uncharacteristically quarreled with his wife on that day and suddenly turned violent on her confirms that he was mentally disturbed when he committed the crime lastly the appellant urges that he had no motive to kill lilia who was scheduled to give birth to their eighth child three  3  days prior to the killing unless overpowered by something beyond his control nobody in his right mind would kill his wife who was carrying his child jealousy the appellant posits is not a sufficient reason to kill a pregnant spouse

parricide, culled from the evidence on record are the following facts which was condensed in the appellees brief to wit at about 125 oclock in the afternoon of august 2 1995 spo2 belino zinampan jr was at the police headquarters at pasig city where he received the report of rolando cayago that he saw the decomposing body of his wife at the abandoned barangay hall of santolan pasig city zinampan spo2 antonio paulite a police photographer and cayago proceeded to the said abandoned barangay hall to verify the report thereat the group saw the dead and decomposing body of a woman zinampan requested cayago to identify the body and on recognizing the shoes worn by the deceased let out a loud cry and thereafter lost consciousness for about five minutes thereafter cayago in answer to zinampans question answered that he does not know who killed his wife zinampan and cayago then returned to the police headquarters where the latters statement was taken by the former at the time cayagos statement was being taken police sr inspector pajota noticed cayagos several inconsistent statements pajota subsequently instructed zinampan spo2 paulite and spo2 delos reyes to further interrogate cayago and who thereafter concluded that cayago was   reluctant and inconsistent in answering our simple questions   pajota then advised cayago to undergo a polygraph examination at camp crame on august 3 1995 when cayago was about to be brought to camp crame for a polygraph test he requested permission to go to the nearby church cayago requested that he be accompanied by spo2 delos reyes who agreed thereat cayago admitted to spo2 delos reyes that he killed his wife myra cayago and was willing to give his statement relative to said killing spo2 delos reyes and cayago returned to the police station and upon such information sr inspector pajota instructed zinampan to secure a lawyer to assist cayago zinampan then requested atty reynario campanilla who agreed to assist cayago atty campanilla conferred with cayago at the office of the investigation division after apprising cayago of his constitutional rights cayago admitted that he killed his wife atty campanilla then advised cayago to personally write down his confession which cayago did for about an hour in the presence of atty campanilla thereafter with the aid of a tape recorder requested cayago to read his admission after informing cayago of his constitutional rights against selfincrimination spo2 delos reyes started taking down cayagos extrajudicial confession again in the presence of atty campanilla and who signed said statement together with cayagoin the case at bar it is clear that appellant strangulated his wife resulting to her death this is supported by appellants own testimony his confession to the police and the medical findings corroborating that she died of asphyxia by strangulation in his testimony appellant claims that he embraced his wife so tight but did not notice she had stopped breathing due to the tightness of the embrace if it were true however that his intention of embracing her was to stop her from pushing him he would have wrapped his arms around her body including her hands yet the medical findings revealed injuries on the neck which is shown by the presence of fracture on the victims windpipe and hemorrhage inside the windpipethe examining physician explained his findings on the victims cadaver which was already in an advanced state of decomposition at the time it was recovered two  2  days after the killing q based on the examination you conducted doctor can you tell us what was the cause of death a the cause of death maam after the internal examination is asphyxia by strangulation because of the presence of fracture on windpipe and also the presence of hemorrhage inside the windpipe q and what could have cause  sic  that injury a this particular finding was caused by the application of extensive pressure on the neck anterior aspects of the neck q like what a could be manual strangulation by using a material enough to exert pressure on the neck q did you prepare a medico legal report based on the examination you conducted a yes maam x x x x x x x x x q now doctor can you explain further the findings that you stated here in your medico legal report in this portion laceration is noted at the posterior uterine wall with extrusion of the segments of the small intestines a this only shows that there is laceration at the uterus and this is at the posterior portion at the back portion of the uterus and this means that something was inserted thru the vagina and eventually lacerating the uterus further examination showed that the small intestine of the deceased/herniated or passed thru this particular lacerations and was eventually entruded thru the vaginal opening q can you tell us doctor what could have cause  sic  this injury a it is highly probable that this was caused by something hard inserted thru the vaginal opening up to the uterus and extensive pressure was applied upon insertion of the material q what do you mean by extensive pressure a well considering maam that it created a laceration on the uterus then a pressure must be used to cause that lacerations q with that same object a yes maamthere is no indication that his wife was sick as to succumb to an immediate difficulty or cessation of breathing in any case appellants testimony before the trial court is clear and categorical that his wife died in his own hands q what else happened a because there were already passersby she was

the minutest detail which would have been known only to him thus 55 t — ano ang ginawa mo sa pagkakataong ito s — niyakap ko po siya ng mahigpit na mahigpit hanggang sa masakal ko siya 56 t — papaano

all her clothing including her panty and bra to make it appear that she was raped this shows the probability that the victim sustained injuries in her vaginal opening and lacerations in her uterus as found in the autopsy report  
homicide, that on or about the 13th day of june 1991 in the municipality of pulilan province of bulacan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the said accused guillermo cruz @ momoy with intent to kill one albert c bundoc did then and when wilfully unlawfully and feloniously with evident premeditation and treachery with the use of a bladed weapon attack assault and stab the said albert c bundoc hitting the latter on his body thereby causing him stab wounds which directly caused his death that the crime was committed in the nighttime purposely sought by the abovenamed accused to ensure its successful commission contrary to lawthis information was filed with the regional trial court  rtc  of bulacan on 24 july 1991; docketed therein as criminal case no 1377; and assigned to branch 18 in malolos bulacan aside from dr purification alto the witnesses presented by the prosecution were antonio cruz giovani bondoc and alberto bondoc sr an uncle a brother and the father respectively of the victim alberto bondoc jr the evidence for the prosecution upon which the conviction was made to rest is summarized by the trial court in this wise the version of the prosecution on the incident tends to show that on or about 1200 midnight of june 12 1991 while giovani bondoc and antonio cruz were conversing at the kitchen of bondocs house they heard the barking of a dog as if it was being stoned in front of the said house antonio cruz stoop up to investigate and what he saw was accused guillermo cruz standing inside the garage located between the houses of antonio cruz and giovani bondoc but he did not pay attention to him and went back to the kitchen where giovani bondoc was and resumed their conversation then moments later they heard again the same cry of the dog and this time both of them went out of the kitchen to investigate and they saw the accused guillermo cruz stabbed alberto bondoc the victim on the lower part of his abdomen after that they chased the accused but they were not able to overtake him because he went inside the house which was just a few meters away from the scene of the crime and after that they brought alberto bondoc inside their house and sought the help of the other members of the family and brought the victim to the jose reyes memorial hospital after staying one  1  week in the said hospital they brought alberto bondoc at his home to recuperate but at home the wound bled and he was rushed to the provincial hospital in bulacan where he died dra purification who attended the victim at the provincial hospital in malolos testified that she was the one who issued the death certificate of the victim alberto bondoc and that the cause of death was cardio respiratory arrest secondary to hypovolimia which means that the patient suffered shock from loss of blood volume due to stab wound the father of the victim alberto bondoc sr testified that he spent p2200000 for medical burial and wake of his son; p1200000 for funeral expenses  exhibit   d   ; p650000 for medical expenses  exhibit   d21    and p250000 unreceipted expenses during the wakethe trial court also summarized the testimony of the accused who was the sole witness for the defense as follows accused testified on direct examination that on june 12 1991 at about 1200 midnight he stoned the dog of the bondocs house because it was always barking after that antonio cruz and jimmy bondoc came out of the latters house and chased him but they were not able to overtake him because he ran into his house and closed the door however on the next hearing of this case still on direct examination accused twisted his previous testimony this time he said that antonio cruz and jimmy bondoc overtook him because he was not able to close the door as antonio was closely following behind him and jimmy bondoc was already inside his house once inside their house he was hit with a 2 by 2 what happened next because antonio cruz and jimmy bondoc ran away and he just stayed inside the house with his children on cross examination by the state prosecutor he again reverted to his original testimony that antonio cruz and jimmy bondoc did not overtake him because he went inside his house and that they did not hit him with by 2 by 2these summaries faithfully reflect the testimony of the witnesses as borne out by the transcripts of the stenographic notes furthermore on crossexamination the accused admitted that before 12 december 1991 he had a heated altercation with the deceased alberto bondoc jr about a   deepwell partition   and that since then they no longer talked to each otherthe trial court gave full faith to the version of the prosecution for being   credible and believable  and characterized that of the accused as ridiculous because it can be gleaned from the testimony of the accused that it is full of flaws and inconsistencies and the court is not inclined to believe it moreover according to accused only antonio cruz and jimmy bondoc chased him then how could he explain the wound inflicted on alberto bondoc which resulted to the death of the latter unless he was referring to circumstances which transpired subsequent to the stabbing incident how did it come that alberto bondoc was stabbed when the latter was not even one of those who chased himit appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery because of the   sudden unexpected and unprovoked attack by the accused on the victim not to mention the fact that accused purposely sought nighttime to accomplish his intention at the residence of the victim  it made a brief discussion on the unacceptability of the accuseds claim of selfdefense due to lack of proof of the requisites thereforthe accused seasonably appealed from the decision indicating in his notice of appealthat he was appealing therefrom to the court of appeals despite the penalty involved which made the judgment appealable to this courtthe trial court guided by the notice of appeal erroneously transmitted the record of the case to the court of appeals which in turn forwarded the record to this court on 20 september 1994this court accepted the appeal when the accused took the witness stand he openly admitted on direct examination that he   hurt   albert bondoc thus q you are being charged of a crime of murder by means of attacking and stabbing one albert bondoc what can you say about that charge against you a i dont know anything about the charge sir q do you mean to say that on june 12 1991 you did not harm this albert bondoc a i hurt him sir emphasis supplied  realizing forthwith the predicament of the defense the accuseds counsel moved for a continuance which the trial court granted at the continuation of his testimony the accused as correctly noted by the trial court in its summary of the evidence quoted above never mentioned anymore about alberto bondoc jr verily the accused might have been confused or he simply avoided direct confrontation with facts likely to inculpate him for the death of alberto bondoc jr in the process however he confirmed the account of prosecution eyewitnesses antonio cruz and giovani bondoc we do not however agree with the trial courts conclusion that the attack was   sudden unexpected and unprovoked   no convincing evidence supports it the eyewitnesses account was unclear in details and we cannot fairly deduce or draw a conclusion therefrom that indeed the attack was sudden and unexpected antonio cruz who was at a distance of 7 to 8 meters from the crime scenemerely declared as follows prosecutrix tienzo q now what did you do a giovani bondoc and i went out thru the same place where i first went out q and where did you proceed a while we were going out we saw the victim also going out in front of my house and we saw that the victim was stabbed q now who saw first the stabbing a i and giovani bundoc saw the stabbing because we went out togetherx x x x x x x x x q in what part of the body was albert bundoc hit a he was hit at the lower left portion of his abdomen maamgiovani bondoc declared as follows prosecutrix tienzo q and what did you see a i saw guillermo cruz stab my brother x x x x x x x x x q will you describe how was your brother stabbed by guillermo cruz a  witness demonstrating by swaying his arms towards the victim absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which culminated in the death of the victim began and developed treachery cannot be appreciated to qualify the killing to murderneither can evident premeditation be appreciated against the accused for although there is proof that the deceased and the accused had an altercation and were thereafter no longer in talking terms no attempt was made to establish the requisites of evident premeditation viz  a  the time when the accused determined to commit the crime  b  an act manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to his determination and  c  a sufficient lapse of time between such determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his actnighttime cannot be considered to aggravate the accuseds criminal liability the testimonies of prosecution witnesses antonio cruz and giovani bondoc that there was a light coming from the post near the scene of the crimenegate a notion that nighttime was especially sought for or taken advantage of by the accused to facilitate the commission of the crime

palquera revealed this matter in writing to sec ileto upon scrutiny and evaluation this court finds to be credible and convincing as true the testimonies of the aforementioned witnesses sonia alata victor gomez and george montabon who positively and unhesitatingly identified jose obosa as the same person they saw minutes before and shortly after the shooting of sec ferrer and jesus calderon the actuations of obosa as described by them are sufficient circumstances as to lead to the conclusion that he was one of those who shot the two victims aside from that circumstancial evidence more weight is added to the prosecutions proof by the voluntary confession of jose obosa to ricardo palquera that he killed secretary ferrer with the help of two other persons which confession is an evidence of guilt of a high quality  people vs zea 138 scra 77  testimony against ones own interest is of immense value as evidence  people vs caparas 102 scra 791 the appellants main line of defense rests on the alleged disparate testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and their inherent implausibility victor gomez testified that after he heard the shots he saw a man holding a gun presumably a 45 cal because it looks like the gun used by fernando poe jr in the movies and tucked the gun in his waist and that the lone gunman came out of victor medina street where the shooting incident took place and went towards dongalo on the other hand witness george montabon stated in court that he saw three men shoot at a car along victor medina street sonia alata for her part stated that she saw two men standing in front of the sunbeam restaurant along la huerta st immediately before the shooting one of whom she later identified as the appellant the defense stands firm that if there were indeed more than one gunman it is beyond belief why these witnesses remembered only the appellant obosa and failed to identify the others appellant posits that witnesses gomez and montabon being minors at the time were unduly pressured by the police to identify appellant obosa while witness alata a police aid who testified about three months after the incident that she saw obosa at the scene of the crime did so only to aid the much publicized investigation the defense claims that the trial and appellate courts erred in upholding the theory of the prosecution that the appellant a prison inmate serving time and who based on prison records was inside the prison premises at the time of the incident would be allowed to roam outside the prison premises to participate in the killing of a cabinet official the testimony of ricardo palquerra cell mate of appellant obosa that the latter confided to him during several drinking sprees inside their prison cell that obosa shot secretary ferrer and was paid millions of pesos for the   hit   should not have been given credence by the trial and appellate courts possession of alcoholic drinks is prohibited in prison and obosa could not have confided to palquerra about the killing since palquerra himself admitted that he did not know obosa very well if indeed such statements were made the court should have dismissed them as plain braggadocio during drinking sprees the appellant seeks an acquittal on the ground that the appellant was tagged as the fall guy to satisfy the public clamor for the arrest of the killer of secretary ferrer  
murder, on 12 november 1992 around tenthirty in the evening at barangay tagpuro tacloban city diosdado meniano and his wife gloria were awakened by a loud voice from outside their house challenging diosdado to a flight gloria meniano readily recognized the voice as that of accused mamerto durana the challenge was hurled a number of times by durana it was not heeded initially by the diosdado until after durana threatened to go up the house if the former would not go down diosdado decided finally to go down but not without arming himself with a short bolo gloria remained inside the house she peeped through the bamboo slats which served as external walls of their house since the moon was bright she was able to see durana clearly as the intruder she also saw the accused rogelio villanueva hiding near the san francisco plants as soon as diosdado went out of his house he was immediately hacked by villanueva despite the hacking durana continued challenging diosdado to a fight he even taunted the victim   you cannot bear a wound   villanueva and durana then ran away elenita meniano sisterinlaw and neighbor of diosdado also witnessed the hacking incident she testified that on 12 november 1992 she and her husband were awakened by the shouts of mamerto durana challenging diosdado to a fight; that they watched the incident through the window and saw diosdado hacked by villanueva after the former went down from his house; that after diosdado was slain she saw durana brandishing a bolo near the crime scene the body of diosdado meniano was examined by dr angel a cordero medicolegal officer camp kangleion palo leyte who ascribed the cause of death to   shock and hemorrhage due to hacking wounds of the right basal portion of the skull lacerating the spinal column   the defense is alibi mamerto durana claims that in the evening of 12 november 1992 he was in the store of a certain rogelio baganio some 30 meters from the house of the deceased to buy cigarettes and to fetch his children who were watching television in the store baganios store was about half a kilometer away from his residence to the questions of the trial court the witness clearly testified as to the existence of conspiracy between appellant and his coaccused thus  court q i will ask some clarificatory questions the police would have not known the incident if you did not give information to the police right a yes sir q now here you said that mamerto durana was asking from your husband a stick of cigarette did you say this to the police a i did not say that to the police q then how could the police state it here if not given that information by you a i was still confused at that time because of the death of my husband q now here in this excerpt of the blotter the person you identified to the police who hacked your husband was not rogelio villanueva but mamerto durana and apparently this is the information you gave to the police a no sir that is not what i told to  sic  the police q what did you tell to  sic  the police a i told the policemen that it was rogelio villanueva who hacked my husband q why did you not tell the police that the accused here mamerto durana was asking for a stick of cigarette from your husband that is the reason why your husband went out of the house a maybe i was still confused at that time i do not know q but even if you were confused the fact that the dead man here is your husband you cannot be confused which one killed your husband and what preceded a i would not be confused on the person who killed my husband q the court feels that the situation is like this that either you are telling the truth or this complaint was only based on suspicion that it was the two accused who conspired to kill your husband or maybe you did not see the actual killing a it is not only my suspicion because i saw that it was rogelio villanueva who hacked my husband q so it is clear now that what you told the police was that mamerto durana challenged your husband to a fight and not that mamerto durana was asking for a stick of cigarette from your husband a yes sir

her husband arrived he was drunk armed with a bolo he went around the wooden bed and then faced her exasperated she finally stood up pulled his hair got hold of a palopalo and hit him once on the head the assault sent juan hovering down the floor seriously wounded rosaria went to the municipal hall and surrendered to police officer san diego no other witness was presented by the defense an accused who interposes selfdefense admits the commission of the act complained of the burden of proving selfdefense would now be on the accused who must show by strong clear and convincing evidence that the killing is justified and that therefore no criminal liability has attached the first paragraph of article 11 of the revised penal code requires in a plea of selfdefense  1  an unlawful aggression on the part of the victim  2  a reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused to prevent or repel it and  3  the lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non for the justifying circumstance of selfdefense without it there can be no selfdefense whether complete or incomplete that can validly be invoked the importance of this requisite must remain underscored in de luna vs court of appeals the court has explained     we did repeatedly say before that whether complete or incomplete selfdefense by its very nature and essence always would require the attendance of unlawful aggression initiated by the victim which must clearly be shown when unlawful aggression on the victims part is alone established incomplete selfdefense is so appreciated merely as an ordinary mitigating circumstance under article 13 paragraph 1 of the code when such unlawful aggression is coupled with still another element of selfdefense incomplete selfdefense becomes a privileged mitigating circumstance referred to in article 69 of the revised penal code that entitles the accused to a reduction of the penalty imposed by law for the felony by one or two degrees depending on the conditions and circumstances therein obtaining the presence of the requisite of unlawful aggression is pivotal in the case at bench appellant has sought to prove unlawful aggression by her testimony; thus — q please tell the court what was that unusual incident a that night as i was taking a rest my husband arrived and he was drunk when i was on top of our wooden bed i saw him armed with a bolo going around me i lost my patience  nagdilim ang aking paningin  i got hold of a palopalo and hit him on his head sir q and what was your relative position as compared to the position of the victim when you hit him with a palopalo a he was facing me and i was on top of the wooden bed and as i was on top of it i hit him sir x x x x x x x x x q you also testified that prior to that incident before you hit your husband with a palopalo he was armed with a bolo is that correct a yes sir q where did he get that bolo if you know a at the post near the wooden bed sir q are you aware as to the whereabouts of that bolo now a i do not know sir in people vs pletado the court quoting from people vs bausing has reiterated the acceptable test in determining the presence of unlawful aggression; viz      f or unlawful aggression to be appreciated there must be an actual sudden unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof and not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude  people vs pasco jr supra; people vs rev 172 scra 149  and the accused must present proof of positively strong act of real aggression  pacificar vs court of appeals 125 scra 716 ;people vs aquiatan 123 scra 501 ;people vs aquino 124 scra 835  unlawful aggression must be such as to put in real peril the life or personal safety of the person defending himself or of a relative sought to be defended and not an imagined threat by her own admission appellant only thought that her husband would strike her answering questions from the trial court she testified court q was he really about to strike you a yes sir q what made you say that a because even before he was doing that to me sir q but at that very precise moment were you really certain that he was going to hit you a i am sure that he will hit me sir q was it necessary to hit him with this palopalo a i hit him because i defended myself sir  emphasis supplied  in fact appellants claim of selfdefense was belied by her own daughter milagros who declared that even before the victim could get his bolo appellant already picked up her palopalo and hit him q you also made mention in your statement particularly in question no 6 to which you answered   nakarinig po ako ng kalabugan   what is that noise all about a both of them were pulling the lawanit and as they were pulling the lawanit juan ignacio then freed the lawanit and was about to get his bolo but my mother was able to get at once the palopalo and hit juan ignacio sir x x x x x x x x x q mrs witness you said during the crossexamination that the deceased tried to get a bolo is that correct a yes sir q and do you know where the deceased was keeping his bolo a just opposite the place where they were sleeping sir q what was the position of juan ignacio when you saw him as you said he was getting a bolo a he stood up to get his bolo but he felt so weak because he was drunk sir  emphasis supplied  21 selfdefense being essentially a factual matter furthermore is best addressed by the trial court here the trial court has also observed accuseds claim of selfdefense cannot be sustained the bolo which was allegedly in victims possession and with which the victim allegedly attempted to hit the accused was never found as in fact admittedly its whereabouts unknown to the accused  tsn p 4 july 29 1992 hearing  who naturally would have preserved the same and utilized it in evidence to corroborate her claim under the circumstances the existence of the bolo particularly on the occasion alleged is even doubtful

confederating and helping one another with treachery and evident premiditation  sic  and with intent to kill and while armed with a gun and bladed weapon did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault shot  sic  and stab rodolfo gabuat @ spud hitting the latter of  sic  the different parts of his body and as a consequence said rodolfo gabuat @ spud sustained injuries which directly caused his death contrary to law the facts according to the prosecution the facts of the case as summarized by the trial court are as follows    rodolfo gabuat who is known as   spud   his wife anna marie and their child were sleeping in their house at 143 university avenue malabon metro manila in the early hours of may 10 1992 when at around 200 oclock in the morning they were awakened by shouts coming from the outside rodolfo opened the door and went down but he was suddenly pulled by the hand by accused roberto  sic; should read   robert    layno who is called boy making rodolfo stumble the latter was then hit with a gun in the face by a certain   inag   alexander layno alias alex followed by stabbing rodolfo at the back with an ice pick accused roberto  sic  layno then shot rodolfo with a gun he was then armed as rodolfo was already lying on the ground face down rodolfo was hit at the back accused danilo layno who is known as danny was standing nearby when rodolfo was shot anna marie rodolfos wife saw what boy inag and alex did to her husband because she immediately followed him she peeped from the house first and then went down to help her husband whom the three  3  left after boy shot him however as anna had approached rodolfo danny started approaching them armed with a bladed weapon making anna marie retreat to their house danny then left and again anna marie returned to rodolfo but danny returned and anna marie retreated once more when danny finally left the place anna marie shouted and asked their neighbors to help them rodolfo was brought to the jose r reyes memorial hospital and then to the chinese general hospital where he died of pneumonia due to the fatal gunshot wound he sustained at the back  exhs g and f and testimony of dr valentin bernales nbi medico legal officer  on may 12 1992 anna marie later executed a sworn statement narrating the incident  exh b  she also claimed that p3400000 was spent for the death and burial of her husband according to the defense the trial courts summary of the defenses version of the facts was reproduced in appellants brief thus accused roberto  sic  layno known as boy and accused danilo layno known as danny denied the accusation against them boy maintained that he attended the wake of a certain choleng fornales 80 to 100 meters away from his house from 800 oclock in the evening of may 9 1992 to 300 oclock in the morning of may 10 1992 from the wake boy went home he knows of no reason why anna marie gabuat pointed to him as the one who killed her husband danny on the other hand maintained that he was sleeping he was awakened by shouts of aling dory  rodora nalus trinidad  about a trouble outside danny was about to get out but was prevented by aling dory from doing so rodora nalus trinidad or aling dory insisted that she was making doormats at about 200 oclock in the morning of may 10 1992 when she heard people uttering curses she went out and saw nancy embracing her husband junior gabuat and saying   tama na tama na   as junior was himself uttering the words   putang ina mo bumaba ka diyan ng makita mo ang hinahanap mo   at this point spud or rodolfo gabuat juniors brother went down from his house junior then fired the gun he was holding at rodolfo rodolfo fell down slowly at the stairs nancy said   hayan putang ina ninyo tuloy kapatid mo ang tinamaan ng baril ninyo   junior lifted rodolfo to the   silong   of the house myrna sister of junior and spud arrived and directed that the bloodstains be cleaned and said   pagdating ng pulis mga layno ang isigaw ninyo boy layno   for this reason aling dorys soninlaw boy and the other laynos are being charged for the killing of spud aling dory added that she herself thereafter went to the nearby wake where  she  saw boy playing cards she saw danny later about to get out of the house but prevented him from doing so when it was already daylight aling dory reported to the barangay captain the incident she witnessed she also asked her   balae   and her son to report the matter to the police but the two were told by new policemen to report the same to the detachment headquarters aling dory also added she was asked by myrnas husband what happened and she told him it was your   bayaw   who killed your other   bayaw   aling dory however did not give any statement to the police however aling dorys claim that the victim was killed by his own brother junior gabuat was denied by the latters wife nancy gabuat who   stressed that rodolfo had already  been  shot when she went down and that it was not junior who shot him nancy executed a sworn statement narrating what she saw starting from the point when anna marie was already with her bloodied husband up to the time danny finally left and what she did thereafter  exh c    the accusedappellants contend that the evidence presented by the prosecution was inadequate to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt this contention is based largely on their submission that the affidavit and testimony of anna marie gabuat contained discrepancies which totally destroyed her credibility as a witness these alleged discrepancies as stated by the defense are as follows 1 in her testimony she stated that when she peeped through the door of her house after hearing voices outside she saw   boy layno inag alex danny   in her sworn statement she did not mention danny or appellant danilo layno 2 in her testimony she stated that while her husband was going down the stairs boy layno pulled him by the hands causing him to fall face down to the ground thereupon inag hit her husband on the face with a gun alex stabbed him twice on the back with an ice pick and boy layno shot him once on the back while this was going on appellant danilo layno was allegedly simply standing by holding a bladed weapon in her sworn statement she made no mention of the presence of appellant danilo layno during the alleged incident much less of his holding a bladed weapon 3 in her testimony she stated that after the assault on her husband the three namely boy layno inag and alex ran away   matapos na masaksak mabaril at mapalo sa mukha ang mister ko itong tatlo nagtatakbo at ako naman nagmamadali akong lumapit sa mister ko   in her sworn statement she did not mention appellant danilo layno as one of the assailants who ran away 4 in her testimony she stated that after the assault she approached her husband to help him but appellant danilo layno appeared with a bladed weapon so she retreated when appellant left she again tried to go to the aid of her husband but appellant danilo layno returned and she retreated once more when appellant danilo layno finally left she and some of her neighbors brought her husband to the hospital in her sworn statement she said that as she was going to her husband to help him she saw appellant danilo layno coming so she retreated when appellant danilo layno left she and her neighbors brought her husband to the hospital she did not say that appellant danilo layno tried to stop her from helping her husband twice as she did in her testimony much less did she mention that appellant danilo layno was armed with a bladed weapon 8 appellants contentions are without merit the categorical and positive eyewitness testimony of anna marie gabuat that robert layno shot her husband and that danilo layno while holding a knife approached her twice as she was trying to help her husband who had just been shot and stabbed is clear consistent credible and sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and to overturn the presumption of innocence in their favor the alleged discrepancies between her affidavit or sworn statement given to the malabon police investigator on may 14 1992 visavis her testimony in court are not fatal defects in her affidavit she related the following 7 t isalaysay mo ang pangyayari s nagising kaming magasawa sa ingay sa labas ng bahay namin ang

murder, that on or about the 7th day of march 1995 in the evening at brgy prado municipality of umingan province of pangasinan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with intent to kill with treachery and evident premeditation armed with firearms conspiring confederating and helping one another did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and shoot one bartolome p lizardo causing his death as a consequence to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the said bartolome p lizardo the facts as established by the evidence may be synthesized as follows at around 930 oclock on the evening of march 7 1995 two men in camouflage uniforms went to bartolome lizardos bungalow at barangay prado umingan pangasinan and asked for a ride allegedly because their vehicle was out of order sionita lizardo the wife of bartolome who was then sleeping at the store beside their bungalow was roused by her husbands calls from the window of his room this window overlooking the left side of the store was higher than the store by about 1 1/2 meters he asked her to go and wake up their son agustin who lived in another house 25 meters away sionita went out walked quickly to agustins house and woke up the latter she then returned to the store at this point one of the men bought cigarettes the other asked for water and bartolome who was still at the window of his room asked sionita to do as requested as sionita stepped out to comply her skirt got caught on the barrel of the m16 rifle carried by one of the two men and the latter apologized saying   sorry   suddenly feeling nervous she walked backwards from the duo thus she was able to see the two as they continued to converse with her husband who was still by his window looking down when she was about 5 meters away one of the two pointed a flashlight at her husband while the other then raised his m16 rifle and fired a burst at bartolome causing his death thereafter the two hastily fled cristita lizardos testimony corroborated sionitas story cristita a daughter of bartolome and sionita narrated that on the night of march 7 1995 she was in her room at their house in barangay prado when she heard someone calling from outside from her room she went to the kitchen and peeped out of the window she saw two men wearing camouflage uniforms talking to her father and asking for a ride after her mother went to and from agustins house the two bought cigarettes one of them asked for water and then they shot her father after the shooting she rushed to her fathers room and found him sprawled on the floor already dead thereafter she went to her mother and told her what had happened when agustin arrived he told her to get assistance from her future inlaws which she did for her part sionita went to barangay casilan also in umingan then to the umingan police station to ask for help a few hours later the police informed of the incident arrived at the lizardo residence to investigate moreover they set up checkpoints on the national highway at around 430 oclock on the morning of march 8 1995 chief of police rogelio danoli went to the checkpoint at barangay san leon from there he went to the san andres checkpoint but along the way his attention was drawn to a 6 x 6 army truck parked at the highway arriving at the san andres checkpoint he learned that the truck had passed through at around 230 am having been informed earlier that the killers were in camouflage uniform danoli went back to barangay prado to get sionita and cristita he asked the two whether they could identify the killers on sight assured that the witnesses can do so he told them that an army truck had been sighted in barangay san andres they then went to the aforesaid barangay where they found the truck parked in front of the house of a certain lito seriosa danoli entered the house and saw four soldiers inside he informed them that a shooting incident had occurred in barangay prado located 10 kilometers away he asked them if they were amenable to being presented to the witnesses to which the soldiers assented upon entering the seriosa residence sionita and cristita forthwith pointed to two of the soldiers later identified as accusedappellants alejandro magno and brigido ringor as bartolomes assailants both sionita and cristita pointed to alejandro magno as the one who shot bartolome magno and ringor were thus taken into police custody the police also confiscated three m16 rifles which they found in the possession of the soldiers further investigation at the lizardo residence revealed combat boot prints at the scene of the crime morever the police recovered eight spent m16 shells in front of the lizardo store paraffin testing of the twoaccused appellants would however yield negative results similarly the result of the ballistic examination conducted by pascual mangalip on the confiscated m16 rifles indicated that the m16 shells recovered from the scene of the crime were not fired from the confiscated firearms on march 8 1995 the rural health physician of umingan pangasinan dr alex trinidad performed an autopsy on the cadaver of bartolome lizardo following which an autopsy report was prepared with the following findings  1  gunshot wound point of entry left shoulder muscle depth;  2  gunshot wound point of entry left chest

point of entry right chest 2 1/2 inches in length fracturing the 4th rib slightly going upward penetrating the right lobe of the lungs;  6  fractured bone of the right forefinger due to gunshot wound presence of powder burns over the chest cause of death severe internal hemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds  original records p 16  on the other hand the defense interposing denial and alibi presented three other witnesses aside from the testimony of accusedappellants captain rolando reyes the superior officer of accusedappellant alejandro magno testified that a week before march 7 1995 while stationed at camp upi gamu isabela he received a mission order to haul supplies from camp aquino in tarlac to camp upi in isabela consequently he organized a team of noncommissioned officers including accusedappellants magno and ringor to transport the aforesaid supplies while accusedappellant ringor was not a complement of the camp upi personnel he instead being part of the 2nd forward supply support unit based at camp de la cruz echague isabela he became part of the team because captain reyes requested for a truck from camp de la cruz as camp upi had only two 6 x 6 trucks while three trucks were needed to transport the supplies according to capt reyes ringor left camp de la cruz echague driving the aforesaid camps truck at 330 pm of march 7 1995 arriving at camp upi at around 5 oclock in the afternoon once there sergeants magno and jacinto and corporal dagang were assigned as his escorts at 535 pm ringors truck part of a threetruck convoy left camp upi for tarlac one truck was loaded with bamboo and cogon which they dropped off at 7 pm at the residence of a certain lt arnel acosta in echague isabela the convoy left lt acostas residence at 730 pm the going was slow since portions of the highway were undergoing repair and were single lane only they arrived in santiago city isabela at 8 oclock in the evening and at 9 oclock the convoy had only reached diadi nueva vizcaya at 930 pm at the time of bartolomes killing the convoy stopped at the aries restaurant located in barangay baretbet bagabag nueva ecija where the group had their supper they left at 10 oclock that evening reaching san jose city nueva ecija only at 1230 in the morning of march 8 1995 captain reyes stressed that from gamu isabela to san jose city the truck driven by ringor never separated from the convoy when they stopped to have coffee at a carenderia in san jose city sgt ringor asked permission to deviate from their route allegedly because in addition to delivering several pieces of lumber at sgt seriosas residence in umingan he  ringor  had to give his salary to his family also in umingan pangasinan captain reyes approved the request on the condition that they meet in camp aquino tarlac at 830 oclock that morning it was only at this point that the truck driven by ringor with magno jacinto and dagang separated from the convoy the two remaining trucks proceeded to camp aquino arriving there at 330 oclock in the morning of march 8 1995 at 800 oclock that same morning jacinto and dagang arrived at camp aquino with the 6 x 6 truck and informed captain reyes that magno and ringor had been arrested for his part accusedappellant magno flatly denied shooting bartolome lizardo on the witness stand he affirmed captain reyes statement that they were at the aries restaurant at the time of the alleged shooting he averred that they left the convoy at san jose city at around 1230 am march 8 1995 taking the san josecarmen route to get to umingan they passed a pnp checkpoint in lupao nueva ecija at around 1245 am arriving at seriosas residence in umingan at 130 am they unloaded several pieces of lumber owned by sgt seriosa then proceeded to ringors residence at barangay san juan umingan to drop off the latters salary as well as the remaining lumber on board the truck they returned to seriosas residence that same morning arriving there at around 3 oclock in the morning at 545 am policemen entered that seriosa residence two women later entered and pointed to him  magno  and ringor as the killers of bartolome lizardo paving the way to their arrest that same day accusedappellant magno further explained that they were identified only because the killers wore camouflage tshirts identical to what they had on at the time of their alleged identification accusedappellant ringors testimony as well as that of corporal dagang are substantially similar to magnos narrative accusedappellants point to the following excerpt of cristitas testimony as allegedly proving that she was asleep at the time of the incident q did you not say that your father was sleeping and you were in fact sleeping in your room also a yes sir  tsn february 9 1996 p 35  as correctly observed by the solicitor general the abovequoted excerpt should not be considered in isolation of the rest of cristitas testimony while the above statement was made during the ocular inspection of the crime scene held on february 9 1996 cristitas statements during her direct examination are as follows q do you recall madam witness where were you on the night of march 7 1995 a yes sir q where were you then a i was in our house sir q at around 930 in the evening of march 7 1995 where were you a i was in my room and when there was somebody calling i rose up q where did you go when you rose up a at the window of our kitchen q why did you go to the window a to be able to see the persons who were calling q did you see these people call a yes sir q to who did they calling a to my father  tsn november 23 1995 pp 34  likewise on crossexamination cristita declared q it was the call of people from the outside which rose you up from your seat is that right a yes sir q you went to the window at the kitchen in order to see who where those calling to your father in the kitchen a yes sir x x x x x x x x x q you claimed that you were inside your own room when you said your father was shot do you remember that a no sir i was in the window that is why i saw them  tsn january 8 1996 p 2 11  it is clear from the above that cristita was awake and at the window of the kitchen when the shooting incident happened plainly when cristita during the ocular inspection said that she was sleeping she was referring to the time just prior to hearing someone calling after which she got up and went to the window in time to witness the killing of her father similarly accusedappellants rely on the following testimony of cristita given during the ocular inspection to prove that sionita was sleeping at the time of the incident q nobody occupied this store at the time of the incident a my mother was inside sleeping q where in that store was your mother allegedly sleeping a  witness pointing to the wooden bed earlier noted inside the store and situated about 4 meters southeast of where she stood to indicate the exact location of the alleged gunman   tsn february 9 1996 p 35  juxtaposed against cristitas testimony during direct and crossexamination as well as sionitas own testimony also on direct and crossexamination the above pronouncement merely proves that sionita was inside the store at the time of the incident not that she was asleep at the exact time of the incident that sionita was awake during the incident can be gleaned from the following excerpts of her crossexamination q at about 900 oclock in the evening of march 7 1995 you said that you were awaken by your husband the late bartolome lizardo is that right a yes sir q you were then sleeping in a store attached to your house is that right a yes sir q that is on the ground floor correct a yes sir q and you said your husband who was sleeping in the upper floor awakened you is that correct a yes sir q he was telling you to wake your son up named agustin who was sleeping in his house about 25 meters away from your house is that right a yes sir  tsn june 22 1995 p 23  accusedappellants claim that sionita and cristita were sleeping at the time of the incident is thus unfounded and unsupported by the evidence likewise accusedappellants make much capital out of the fact that powder burns were found on the chest of the victim they allege that the presence of powder burns coupled with the fact that the gunshot wounds suffered by the deceased were rounded in shape with inward cleancut edges prove that bartolome was shot at close range contrary to the witnesses assertion that the former was shot at a distance of four meters the examining physician who had been handling medicolegal cases for more than twenty years testified that it is possible to have powder burns at a distance of three to four meters viz q now when you say close range there can only be nitrate on the cadaver or gunpowder burns when the muzzle of the gun the point of the muzzle if the gun is one foot from the body is that right a about a few meters more or less 3 to 4 meters more or less x x x x x x x x x q is it not a fact that gunpowder burns on the body can only be present when the point of the muzzle of the gun is one foot or nearer to the body a i do not believe that because there are several times that i saw powder burns usually more than one foot the distance from the body  tsn july 5 1995 p 2334  moreover the appearance of the wounds themselves negate accusedappellants theory that the victim was shot at close range for had it been at close range the wounds would have shown tearing of tissue in a cruciate or stellate manner  forensic medicine vol i pp 520521  instead the wounds were rounded with regular margins indicating that the victim was shot at an intermediate range rather than point blank they also claim that it was dark at the time there being no light or other source of illumination lastly they argue that granting arguendo that there were kerosene lamps inside the store at the time the lamplight could not have been of any help as the store was closed at the time hence the light from inside could not have lit up the area outside of the store they quote the following testimony of cristita to support their contention q that night and on that particular hour and moment when stranger allegedly stood in front of your store that was already a time when there were no customers expected to patronize your store was it not a yes sir because usually at five oclock we were already closed court alright q according to you at the time your store was closed how did you usually close your store did you put some kind of cloth or maybe a board in front of your store by the grills in order that standing from the outside and looking to it nobody could see anybody inside the store a we used a plywood to close the store sir q and the grills were completely blocked by the covering was it not a yes sir  rollo p 164; accusedappellants emphasis  contrary to accusedappellants claim there was no physical obstruction to cristitas line of view which could have prevented her from seeing the assailants commit the crime as observed by the judge he could   see the concrete flooring of the space in front of the store   the very same space occupied by the assailants at the time of the shooting what could not be seen were the slats of the bamboo grills in front of the store hence it was not impossible for cristita to have seen the assailants anent the claim that there was no illumination cristita testified that there was sufficient moonlight by which to recognize the assailants she also said that the kerosene lamps inside the store were lit at the time of the incident and that the plywood cover of the store had been removed prior to the shooting it must likewise be noted that the assailants had bought cigarettes from sionita thus the latter would have seen up close the features of the two men who shot her husband in passing upon the evidentiary value of the above exhibits of the defense the following observations may be made the mission order dated march 6 1995 directing captain reyes accusedappellants magno and ringor corporal dagang sergeant jacinto and six others to haul supplies from camp aquino in tarlac is merely an unauthenticated copy furthermore it reads   corrected copy destroy all others   which as captain reyes admitted on crossexamination meant that prior to the arrival of the truck from the 2nd fssu they already had a mission order dated march 6 1995 that did not mention personnel coming from the 2nd fssu likewise capt reyes claimed that an additional truck from the 2nd fssu was requested yet no copy of such request was ever presented in connection with their alibi the defense likewise submitted i  a ticket issued to sgt torrado showing that the truck he was driving left camp upi at 530 pm of march 7 1995; ii  a travel slip issued to cpl magaoay showing that the truck he was driving left camp upi at 535 pm of march 7 1995; and iii  a travel slip issued to accusedappellant ringor showing that the truck he was driving left camp dela cruz echague isabela at 330 pm of march 7 1995 the trip ticket issued to torrado and the travel slip issued to cpl magaoay prove that indeed the trucks driven by them left camp upi at 535 pm of march 7 1995 on the other hand the travel slip issued to ringor only shows that he left camp dela cruz at 330 pm of march 7 1995 it cannot be inferred therefrom that he went to camp upi nor that he left the same at 535 pm or march 7 1995 as part of a threetruck convoy to prove that ringor went to camp upi the defense presented an equipment utilization record showing that ringor gassed up at camp upi at 530 pm however not only is said record an unauthorized copy it is also undated hence it does not really prove that ringor was at camp upi on march 7 1995 sionita lizardo testified thus q madam witness you said these two accused shot your husband bartolome lizardo on the night of march 7 1995 tell the court who shot your husband bartolome lizardo court you mean who between the accused atty ulep yes your honor a sgt magno sir x x x x x x x x x court why are you saying a while ago that they referring to both accused shot a magno was the one who shot my husband and it was ringor who focus the flashlight on my husband  tsn may 9 1995 p 1314  and  q now but you recognize these people you pointed to these people as the author of the killing of your husband because of the military uniform is that right a i saw them they came there q you want to tell the court that it was in the store where you recognized them a yes they bought cigarette and they talked with my husband q when did you come to know that the very person who bought the cigarette is magno a at that time sir because they were the ones who came q who among the two a magno and ringor  tsn july 5 1995 p 9  cristita also positively identified magno and ringor q who shot your father a the one who was wearing fatigue uniform but with yellow tshirt inside x x x x x x x x x q can you tell the court who is that person who is wearing yellow tshirt a magno sir q you said madam witness that there were two  2  persons who allegedly were talking with your father at the time your father was shot where was the other a they were side by side with each other sir they focus flashlight to my father q who focused flashlight to your father a the taller one with slimmer built court and who was that if you can identify him a ringor sir  tsn november 23 1995 p 910  parenthetically it bears stressing that sionita and cristita lizardo did not know who ringor and magno were having seen them only that fateful night of march 7 1995 yet they readily pointed to the two early the next day as the assailants of bartolome lizardo  
parricide, the records show that on 28 august 1996 at around 230 in the afternoon appellant and his wife erlinda were inside their house engaged in an animated conversation living with them in the same house in barangay bulbulala la paz abra was appellants father agustin florendo after erlinda was heard to have told imong to go to sleep the latter all of a sudden and without any provocation hacked erlinda with a bolo in the head and other parts of her body the victim could only exclaim   patayennak met ni imong ngen  imong is going to kill me    agustin who was resting at that time witnessed the incident instead of stopping appellant agustin left the house for fear that his son would also attack him agustin sought help from his immediate neighbor ernesto anical and told him   kasano erning patayen yen met ni imong ni baketnan  how is this erning imong is killing his wife    ernesto too became frightened and did not go out of his house; instead he told agustin to go to the barangay captain for assistance agustin went to the house of barangay captain godofredo apuya to report the incident but the latter was not there thus the wife of the barangay captain upon being apprised of what happened hurriedly went out to look for any available barangay tanod for assistance and was able to contact barangay tanod felipe adora agustin on the other hand restrained by fear and shock stayed at the barangay captains house and when he finally returned at about 400 oclock in the afternoon erlinda was already dead in the meantime appellant ran to the house of the barangay captain after hacking his wife when barangay tanod felipe adora arrived at the house of the barangay captain he found appellant there holding a bloodied bolo his hands and feet dripping with blood felipe advised appellant to yield his bolo but the latter did not respond this prompted felipe to grab his hand and take away his bolo when barangay captain godofredo apuya arrived he asked appellant why his hand and feet were covered with blood but the latter did not answer appellant was later taken to the la paz district hospital for treatment of his wound and the police authorities of la paz thereafter took him into custody pending investigation of the incident dr corazon lalin brioso municipal health officer of la paz autopsied the cadaver of the victim and found that she sustained sixteen  16  wounds on various parts of her body four  4  of which were considered fatal and resulted in her instantaneous death due to hypovalemic shock caused by massive hemorrhageon 2 september 1996 appellant was committed at the abra provincial jail during his confinement he was observed to be having difficulty in sleeping he could not eat during meal times most of the time he would stand in his cell without talking to anyone thus on 9 september 1996 he was treated as an outpatient at the abra provincial hospital  aph  the provincial warden then requested a psychiatric examination of appellant to determine whether he was fit to be arraignedon 17 october 1996 appellant was supposed to be arraigned but he appeared without counsel and remained unresponsive to the questions propounded to him on the same date the trial court referred appellant to the baguio general hospital and medical center  bghmc  for psychiatric evaluation since there was no psychiatrist at the aph on 20 november 1996 he went to the bghmc for consultation and was admitted and managed as a case of schizophrenic psychosis paranoid type  schizophreniform disorder he was detained at the hospital and given medication for his illness on 7 june 1997 after confinement for six  6  months and eighteen  18  days he was discharged and recommitted to the provincial jail as he was found fit to face the charges against himwhen finally arraigned on 12 august 1997 appellant pleaded not guilty at the pretrial conference appellant admitted killing his wife but put up the defense of insanity to claim exemption from criminal liability at the initial hearing the prosecution presented agustin florendo godofredo apuya ernesto anical felipe adora and dr corazon lalin brioso as witnesses agustin florendo attested that his son was not in his proper senses on the day of the incident and repeated on crossexamination that appellant was crazy and had been behaving strangely for one  1  year before the incidentbarangay captain godofredo apuya on the other hand stated that he already knew that appellant was mentally ill because in two  2  instances three  3  months prior to the incident he saw him singing dancing and clapping his hands in their yardwitness ernesto anical stated further that on the day of the incident appellant was not in his right senses as he saw him sharpening his bolo with his eyes red and looking very sharp yet he likewise testified that appellant would join the people in their barangay in their drinking sprees and when already drunk he would beat his wifebarangay tanod felipe adora also testified that appellant had been behaving oddly and was somewhat crazy as he saw him ten  10  days before the incident singing and talking to himselfboth godofredo apuya and felipe adora stated that appellant suspected that his wife was having an affair with godofredo for he once went to the house of godofredo looking for her but before the trial could prosper the presiding judge received a letter from the provincial warden asking for the recommitment of appellant to the bghmc because of his unstable mental condition on 8 june 1998 the trial court directed the examination and treatment of appellant but not his admission in the hospital nonetheless appellant was readmitted at the bghmc on 11 june 1998 and discharged on 7 august 1998 on 10 august 1998 upon the assurance of dr elsie i caducoy that appellant was fit to stand trial appellant was called to testify he stated that he did not remember anything that happened on 28 august 1996 but recalled seeing his children days before the incident; that he was brought to the provincial jail by the police authorities; that he thumbmarked a form given him in jail; that he came to know about the death of his wife only when his father told him about it while he was in jail; and that he did not know barangay captain apuya when asked about his alleged affair with his wifein the assailed decision dated 19 august 1998 the trial court held that the crime committed was parricide while no marriage certificate was presented to prove the relationship between appellant and the victim such fact was evident from the testimonies of the witnesses and appellant himself who averred that the victim was his legitimate wife; that the aggravating circumstance of cruelty was present because the victim suffered sixteen  16  wounds; that while it was true that there was evidence that appellant was observed to be doing things out of the ordinary like singing in english dancing laughing or talking alone there was also evidence that he was socializing freely with the other young men in the barangay; that all these were indicative only of mental abnormality that did not excuse him from imputability for the offense; that no expert witness was presented to testify on the insanity of appellant; and the motive of appellant in killing his wife was jealousy appellant florendo now contends that the trial court erred in not acquitting him on the ground of insanity; for appreciating cruelty instead as an aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crime and for upholding the legitimacy of his commonlaw relationship with the victim in order to bring the killing within the ambit of art 246 of the revised penal code the court rejects the plea of insanity insanity under art 12 par 1 of the revised penal code exists when there is a complete deprivation of intelligence in committing the act ie appellant is deprived of reason; he acts without the least discernment because of complete absence of the power to discern; or there is a total deprivation of freedom of the will the onus probandi rests upon him who invokes insanity as an exempting circumstance and he must prove it by clear and convincing evidencethe alleged insanity of florendo was not substantiated by sufficient evidence he was not completely bereft of reason or discernment and freedom of will when he mortally hacked his wife the following circumstancesclearly and unmistakably negate a complete absence of intelligence on his part when he committed the felony  a  he was apparently well until about three  3  to four  4  months prior to his admission in the hospital when he was noted to have blank stares claiming that he was in deep thought because he suspected his wife of having an extramarital affair and at times would confront his wife about the matter but the latter would deny it;  b  that he became irritable at home and was easily angered by his childrens slightest mistakes;  c  that due to his jealousy he claimed that he only wanted to frighten his wife with his bolo in order to confront her but hacked her instead many times to death;  d  he denied having hallucinations at that time or being possessed by an evil spirit;  e  immediately after the incident he went to the barangay captain never thought of running away and apparently felt guilty about what happened;  f  in jail he said he started having auditory hallucinations where he would hear voices commanding him to do something but refused to elaborate on this; and  g  he claimed that he frequently thought of his three  3  children whom he missed so much these were hardly the acts of a person with a sick mind a perusal of appellants testimony would show that he was aware of his emotions bearing and temperament except for his testimony in open court that he had no recollection of what happened on 28 august 1996 he attested that he saw his children a few days before the incident; that he was brought to the provincial jail by the police authorities; and that he thumbmarked a form given him in jail since he remembered the vital circumstances surrounding the ghastly incident he must have been in full control of his mental faculties his recall of the events that transpired before during and after the stabbing incident as well as the nature and contents of his testimony does not betray an aberrant mind an insane person has no full and clear understanding of the nature and consequences of his act the issue of insanity is a question of fact for insanity is a condition of the mind not susceptible of the usual means of proof as no man would know what goes on in the mind of another the state or condition of a persons mind can only be measured and judged by his behavior establishing the insanity of an accused requires opinion testimony which may be given by a witness who is intimately acquainted with appellant or who has rational basis to conclude that appellant was insane based on the witness own perception of appellant or who is qualified as an expert such as a psychiatristthe first four  4  witnesses of the prosecution were one in alleging that appellant was crazy and had lost his mind as they noticed him to be behaving oddly ie singing dancing and talking to himself the prosecution witnesses may have testified that appellant appeared to them to be insane prior to during and subsequent to the commission of the crime but there is a vast difference between an insane person and one who has worked himself into such a frenzy of anger that he fails to use reason or good judgment in his action the fact that a person behaves crazily is not conclusive that he is insane the prevalent meaning of the word   crazy   is not synonymous with the legal terms   insane     non compos mentis     unsound mind     idiot   or   lunatic   the popular conception of the word   crazy   is being used to describe a person or an act unnatural or out of the ordinary a man may behave in a crazy manner but it does not necessarily and conclusively prove that he is legally sothe evidence adduced consisting of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that appellant was insane immediately before or on the day the crime was committed consisted merely of assumptions and is too speculative presumptive and conjectural to be convincing their observation that appellant manifested unusual behavior does not constitute sufficient proof of his insanity because not every aberration of the mind or mental deficiency constitutes insanity hence exempting in the case at bar appellant was diagnosed to be suffering from schizophrenia when he was committed to the bghmc a few months after he killed his wife medical books describe schizophrenia as a chronic mental disorder characterized by a persons inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality and is often accompanied by hallucinations and delusions symptomatically schizophrenic reactions are recognizable through odd and bizarre behavior apparent in aloofness or periods of impulsive destructiveness and immature and exaggerated emotionality during the initial stage the common early symptom is aloofness a withdrawal behind barriers of loneliness hopelessness hatred and fear frequently the patient would seem preoccupied and dreamy and may appear   far away  wellsettled is the rule that an inquiry into the mental state of an accused should relate to the period immediately before or at the very moment the felony is committedthe medical findings of the bghmc which diagnosed appellants mental disorder as schizophrenic psychosis paranoid type refer to appellants treatment after the incident happened it is bereft of any proof that appellant was completely deprived of intelligence or discernment at the time or at the very moment he killed his wife it is inconclusive as to whether he was insane at the time immediately preceding or at the very moment of the killing

coworkers pabling and   junior   salgado who were drinking tuba near the bandsaw according to accusedappellant at first he refused to have a drink as he had not yet eaten dinner but as the group was insistent he took a drink and then went back to his cooking minutes later however marata was back to borrow money in order to buy some more liquor for the group accusedappellant said he had no money but marata invited him to join the group anyway accusedappellant went with marata but refused to have a drink saying he had to sleep because he was very tired marata again asked him if he could spare some money to buy some liquor accusedappellant again answered he had none since they had no more to drink pabling and salgado left leaving marata and accusedappellant behindbut even after the two had left marata still asked accusedappellant for money so that they could continue drinking when accusedappellant said he really had no money marata became angry and chided him saying that for a newcomer accusedappellant was already trying to be smart he called accusedappellant a braggarteven as he gave him a blow on the left breast marata then allegedly pulled out a hunting knife about 67 inches long and tried to stab the accusedappellant but the latter was able to hold maratas hand twist it and then kick him in the groin with his right knee causing marata to loosen his hold of the knife accusedappellant was thus able to wrest the knife with his left hand marata then picked up a 2   x 2   x 14   piece of wood and struck accusedappellant on the left back portion of his bodyaccusedappellant pleaded with marata to stop beating him but the latter struck him again with the piece of wood accusedappellant parried the blow with his left arm he showed a scar about 2 inches in length near his wrist which was allegedly caused by the blowaccusedappellant claims that as he backed off he lost his balance and fell to the ground for this reason he used his right leg to parry the blows as he cringed in pain from the injury on his right leg which he cradled in his chest with his right arm marata sat astride him and pinned down his right arm to the ground in that position accusedappellant stabbed marata in the stomach with his left arm which held the knife this forced marata to disengage from accusedappellant according to accusedappellant he warned marata not to come near him but marata rushed towards him just the same accusedappellant therefore stabbed him in the lower right portion of the stomach marata twirled as he cried for help and fell to the ground accusedappellant said he then went to the building under construction and holed himself up in a room on the second floor for fear of reprisal from maratas friends he stayed there until 500 am when he

murder,the prosecution relying mainly on the testimony of two eyewitnesses  celestino atun and percival amador  and of the policemen who went to the scene of the crime upon noticing the commotion it produced sought to establish the following between 100 and 200 oclock in the afternoon of march 27 1962 some persons had a quarrel inside the new bicol carinderia an eatery located near the legaspi port market legaspi city after a short while the protagonists came out through the backdoor of the carinderia jose manansala had rodrigo in a tight embrace from behind with his arms under the latters armpits while rodrigo was in that position of apparent helplessness avelino stabbed him with a balisong or batangas knife the stabbing continued while rodrigo was led or dragged by jose to a bamboo bed  papag  nearby and even after rodrigo had been forced down on it in a prone position when the policemen who responded to the commotion arrived they found avelino still holding the fatal weapon and rodrigos limp body bathed in his own blood stretched on the papag a taxicab was commandeered to take the wounded man to a hospital but he expired even before the vehicle could start the autopsy later conducted by dr antolin lotivio a resident physician of the albay provincial hospital revealed that the victim died from massive hemorrhage and shock as a result of the multiple wounds  thirteen in all  sustained by him in the chest abdomen back and the extremities the accused did not take the witness stand however they presented two witnesses domingo daria and salvador petilos who said that they saw the whole incident the substance of their testimony is as follows early in the afternoon of march 27 1962 avelino a smalltime peddler of textiles in the legaspi port market was eating his lunch inside one of the eateries dotting the market site when rodrigo aringo alias diego a baggage boy in the same market approached him and demanded his fee for having carried avelinos baggage avelino said he was willing to pay for the services rendered at noon but not for those rendered earlier in the morning he then took some money from his pocket and proferred it to rodrigo obviously peeved at having been thus publicly rebuffed rodrigo brusquely brushed avelinos hand aside and instantly gave him a fist blow in the face avelino fell from his seat; he tried to get up but was given another blow and then a third as he reeled from the force of the last blow a batangas knife he was carrying fell from his trousers pocket avelino picked up the knife and rodrigo seeing that he was armed rushed to the carinderias kitchen and returned almost immediately with a 10inch knife in his hand with it he swung at his antagonist but the latter evaded the blow meanwhile appellant jose manansala an uncle of avelino noticed the commotion from outside the carinderia where he was loading baggage on a parked truck some six meters away he shouted at rodrigo to stop rodrigo paid no heed and instead delivered another thrust at avelino who again evaded it at the third attempt jose embraced rodrigo from behind and it was at that moment that avelino stabbed rodrigo and inflicted the numerous wounds which proved fatal jose took the kitchen knife from rodrigo and threw it away and then released his limp body on the papag nearby when the policemen arrived avelino was still clutching the knife he had used both appellants were apprehended appellants plea is selfdefense this is predicated on the theory that the deceased was himself armed with a knife with which he tried to stab avelino as declared by the two witnesses for the defense several circumstances however belie this claim first avelino sustained no knife wound at all second although several policemen arrived at the scene of the incident almost immediately after it happened not one of them saw the knife allegedly used by rodrigo nor was it shown to them or at least brought to their attention by either of the appellants indeed when avelino surrendered to the policemen he declined to give any statement which in the natural course of things he would have done if he had acted merely to defend himself a protestation of innocence or justification is the logical and spontaneous reaction of a man who finds himself in such an inculpatory predicament as that in which the policemen came upon the appellants with avelino still clutching the death weapon and his victim dying before him but while it is clear that avelino did not act in legitimate selfdefense the trial court correctly held that there was sufficient provocation on the part of the victim the evidence given by the witnesses for the defense as to how and why the fight started and as to the fact that the deceased hit avelino with his fist is not controverted by the witnesses for the prosecution who did not see the incident from the very beginning and one fist blow at least is confirmed by the doctor who treated avelino for a contusion around one eye jose manansala was found guilty as coprincipal on the ground that there was concert of action between him and his nephew the evidence does not justify this finding beyond reasonable doubt there is no showing that the killing was agreed upon between them beforehand no motive for it has been shown other than the provocation given by the deceased; and such motive was true only insofar as avelino was concerned the circumstances indicate that if jose embraced rodrigo and rendered him helpless it was to stop him from further hitting avelino with his fists however jose is not entirely free from liability for it has been established that even after the first knife thrust had been delivered he did not try to stop avelino either by word or overt act instead jose continued to hold rodrigo even forced him down on the bamboo bed with avelino still pressing the attack withal it cannot be said that joses cooperation was such that without it the offense would not have been accomplished but although not indispensable it was a contributing factor if joses initial intent was free from guilt it became tainted after he saw the first knife thrust delivered the thirteen wounds must have taken an appreciable interval of time to inflict and joses cooperation facilitated their infliction he must therefore be held liable as an accomplice 
homicide,that on or about the 7th day of june 1964 in the municipality of talugtog province of nueva ecija republic of the philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused conspiring and confederating with one another with intent to kill and with evident premeditation and by means of treachery did then and there wilfully unlawfully criminally and feloniously strike and hit one lorenzo grospe on his head with a piece of hard wood for several times thereby causing the instantaneous death of said lorenzo grospe pedro moreno and herminio caspillo were acquitted by the court of first instance of nueva ecija presided by judge placido c ramos and dionisio sibayan whose appeal is the subject of this decision was adjudged guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the sum of p6000 to suffer the accessories provided by law and to pay the costs witnesses for the prosecution seven all told were chief of police fidel dumandan of talugtog carmen castillo  surviving spouse of the deceased lorenzo grospe  barrio captain marceliano caspillo of osme district in talugtog alejandro soriano municipal judge alfredo leybag of talugtog patrolman benjamin de fiesta of the same municipality and dr artemio da jose rural health officer the integrated testimony of carmen castillo marceliano caspillo alejandro soriano and benjamin de fiesta points unerringly to the appellant dionisio sibayan as the slayer of the deceased the victim lorenzo grospe and dionisio sibayan were neighbors it was about nine oclock on the night of june 7 1964 when these two had an altercation immediately followed by sibayan attacking grospe with a piece of hard wood fracturing the latters skull and causing his death alejandro soriano and benjamin de fiesta identified sibayan as the assailant of the deceased soriano likewise declared that he saw sibayan standing over the dying victim; de fiesta further testified that he saw him run away from the scene of the crime de fiesta even gave chase but was unable to apprehend him supporting the declarations of these two witnesses was the admission to marceliano caspillo made by the appellants wife  clarita castillo  in the presence of de fiesta and soriano that her husband succeeded in killing grospe in spite of her attempt to stop him municipal judge leybag testified that he notarized exhibit a which in essence is a sworn confession accomplished by sibayan and which substantially recites that it was he who killed the deceased by hitting him on the head with a piece of wood judge leybag further declared that he inquired from the appellant whether the confession was voluntary and whether the statements contained therein were correct and true and that sibayan replied in the affirmative it is also undenied that in the morning of the next day sibayan and his wife disappeared from talugtog which fact left its indelible impression on the judge a quo prompting him to remark  in his decision  in connection therewith that not only did he run away from the scene of the incident but he disappeared entirely from talugtog that evening as well as in the following days what dionisio sibayan did was to fly away from the scene of the incident and from talugtog according to him he proceeded to manila to look for work it is strange however why even his wife had to leave early that very morning if the purpose only of sibayan in going to manila to look for work considering however that dionisio sibayan is related to the deceased lorenzo grospe and it is the custom in the rural communities for anyone to attend to the burial of his relatives the court cannot reconcile itself to the explanation of dionisio sibayan that instead of attending the burial of a relative he would leave so early in the morning for manila to look for work at least if this is so his wife should have remained but even his wife disappeared when dionisio sibayan left talugtog that evening and could not be seen anymore the only logical conclusion that could be established is that he really fled away from the scene of the crime this flight indicates the consciousness of guilt on the part of dionisio sibayan only the appellant testified for the defense after a perceptive and careful examination of his declarations it is sufficient for us to state in appraisal of his testimony that  1  his denial of the voluntariness of the execution of exhibit a cannot stand in the face of the positive testimony of judge leybag to the contrary and  2  that the material contradictions between the appellants testimony in court and the contents of exhibit a render doubtful  so the court noted and with which we agree  the veracity of his testimony in court

armando called francis and princess joy and told them that their mother had an accident armando and francis carried leah and brought her inside the house upon his fathers instructions francis wiped his mothers face with towel soaked in lukewarm water armando asked her if she wanted to be brought to the hospital but leah refused the following morning armando noticed that leah had two lumps at the

maltreated or manhandled leah po3 joel stephen b casador testified that as far as he knew armando and leah had a good marital relationship nenita garcia a neighbor of armando and leah testified that early in the evening of august 15 1996 she saw husband and wife drinking under the   datiles   tree in their yard at around 800 in the evening leah passed by her house on the way to tia felis house thereafter armando followed leah to tia felis house nenita observed that armando was limping he and leah went back to their house together nenita said that she did not see the couple quarrel nor was there anything unusual in the behavior of the couple that night it is axiomatic in criminal jurisprudence that when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses an appellate court will normally not disturb the factual findings of the trial unless the lower court has reached conclusions that are clearly unsupported by evidence or unless it has overlooked some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which if considered would affect the result of the casethe rationale for this rule is that trial courts have superior advantages in ascertaining the truth and in detecting falsehood as they have the opportunity to observe at close range the manner and demeanor of witnesses while testifyingin this case the trial court declared that the children francis and princess joy the principal prosecution witnesses testified   in a logical candid and straightforward manner describing in detail what they saw and heard in a manner characteristic of witnesses who are telling the truth  the court finds no reason to deviate from these findings as the records fully support the same the children recalled the sordid events that happened in the evening of august 15 1996 involving their parents without any trace of bias impelled by no other motive than to bring justice to their mothers senseless death francis for one graphically testified in this manner fiscal chua q how about your

mother prosecutor chua after you poured water on your mother did your mother came to consciousness witness no maam prosecutor chua what else did your father do witness my father tried to resuscitate her by supplying air into her mouth prosecutor chua did your mother recover witness no maamthe testimonies of francis and princess joy who are of tender age innocent and guileless pointing to their father as the person responsible for the death of their mother deserve full faith and credence considering that they would not impute a heinous crime against him for which he could be meted reclusion perpetua or even the death penalty if such were not the truth a witness testimony against a blood relative is given great weight if it is not found to have been motivated by ill willmoreover the version of francis and princess joy as to what actually transpired on that night of august 15 1996 is more credible than that proffered by the appellant the childrens testimonies are buttressed by the findings of dr canto the neurological surgeon who attended to leah when she was confined in the hospital and dr cruel of the commission on human rights who conducted the postmortem examination on leahs body indeed the appellants claim that the death of leah resulted from accident ie she slipped and hit her head on two stones flies in the face of incriminating medical findings as opined by dr canto he found it difficult to believe that the injuries sustained by leah resulted from a bad fall the testimony of the doctor is as follows q doctor you saw the patient leah n dalag of course witness a yes maam q you examined her personally a yes maam q you examined the extent of her injuries when she was brought in to the hospital and you saw her for the first time witness a yes and in fact i have to add in this particular case i was interested specifically because i was suspecting some foul play because the history it was told by the resident physician that she fell but i saw a lot of discrepancies — injuries fiscal chua q so will you please describe the injuries that you have observed when you examined this particular patient and such injuries that are now reflected in this diagram which have been made under your direction which you have testified earlier a she had periorbital hematomas q can you explain that in the laymans language a okey she had a blackeye she had also evidence of contusion hematoma also on the right mastoid area q where is that doctor a behind the ear those two  2  signs indicate usually basal fracture and hemorrhage on the base of the brain fiscal chua q what else have you noticed on the face of the patient doctor witness a the one which really struck me and i was suspicious then were the apparent fingermarks court q where witness q in the neck fiscal chua q and what does that indicate — these clawmarks on the neck which arose your suspicion a they were located on the anterior part of the neck q and what does this indicate how does this mark came into the neck of the patient a well to be honest it was my own opinion then because there was a discrepancy from the injuries i have seen and the alleged accident which was told by the informer that time fiscal chua q and doctor in your opinion what could have caused this injury on the neck witness a i was suspecting that she was strangled q now doctor there is also a mark on this diagram here can you tell us what is this on the chest a that is another contusion abrasion which i noted q where a on the anterior part of the chest at the level of the syphoid process this is the most interior part of the sternum q in laymans language doctor what part of the body is that a well it is just midline just below the level of her breast q now doctor there are also here some marks on the ear of the patient as drawn here can you tell or explain this to us witness a this was explained earlier these are hematomas contusions hematomas at the mastoid area it is usually a sign of basal skull fracture fiscal chua q now doctor was this contusion and hematoma found on both ears of the patient leah dalag a i cannot recall but based on this drawing it is bilateral — on both sides of the ears q doctor have you noticed upon examination of the patient whether or not blood was coming out from any part of her body a i cannot recall q what else have you noticed doctor aside from hematomas and contusions a i cannot recall everything but i note some abrasions on the extermities  sic  — in the elbows q how about on the temple on the head aside from those that you have described on the two  2  ears how about the portion on the head witness a none fiscal chua q now doctor is it possible that a human brain can sustain internal injuries without outward manifestation which may be visible to the naked eyes a yes maam q can you give specific instance doctor can you explain further a the brain floats inside the skull imagine the brain contained in a glass jar with fluid the brain floats there and any movement of the jar will cause also an accelerationdeceleration movement if you translate it into a force applied to the skull for example a vehicular accident — the brain can bust to and fro or even rotated around the skull and cause the internal injuries court q just like the effect of boxing witness a yes your honor court q whether professional or amateur boxing a yes your honor fiscal chua q how about doctor when you choke a person shake him or her can it sustain brain damage atty grijaldo we object to the question your honor that already assumes that this witness your honor is being presented as an expert witness your honor the purpose of presenting this witness is to testify on his findings on the injuries sustained by the deceased your honor he was not presented as an expert witness your honor fiscal chua he was court pa ro i have been keeping track of the qualification of the physician he is not an ordinary physician but he has specialized in neurology that is why he is considered as a specialist atty grijaldo but he was offered to testify on his findings on the deceased your honor court that is why the findings here are contusions he is explaining now why he arrived at this conclusion he is going into the details that is how i understand overruled may answer the court would like also to know about that witness a choking with a finger or even whatever means an assailant can inflict causing several injuries; not only the shaking of the head at the same time he also decrease oxygenation of the brain because there are several factors involved here first the patient cant breath therefore she will have asphyxia choking can also compress the carotid arteries which supply the main supply of blood to the brain this also causes hypoxemia which decrease oxygenation of the blood so aside from the injuries being sustained by the brain by the force acted upon by the shaking it causes swelling of the brain because of the other factors that i mentioned — hypoxemia and asphyxia fiscal chua q now doctor assuming the facts as already established by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as well as what you have testified can you state with reasonable certainty whether in your opinion the injuries suffered by the deceased was the direct result of the violence and batterings from the hands of the accused armando dalag on august 15 1996 atty grijaldo objection your honor court sustained do not point to the accused reform fiscal chua i reform your honor q assuming the facts as already established by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the injuries that you have described just right now can you state in your own opinion with reasonable certainty that the injuries suffered by the deceased was the direct result of the violence and the batterings she received on august 15 1996 or before she was brought to the hospital` a yes maam q now further assuming the facts established by other witnesses in this case can you state with reasonable certainty whether in your opinion the injuries sustained by the deceased leah n dalag could have caused her death on august 22 1996 a yes maamthe foregoing testimony of dr canto as to the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by leah not only confirms the testimonies of the children but likewise exposes as utterly preposterous the appellants claim that she suffered from a bad fall notably dr cantos findings were corroborated by the findings of dr cruel who conducted the postmortem examination on leahs corpse     
homicide, acting second assistant provincial fiscal of bayombong nueva vizcaya albert g castillo had charged appellant in an information that reads   that on or about 730 oclock in the night of may 27 1983 at barangay comon municipality of aritao province of nueva vizcaya philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused sergio briones y silapan @ loreto who was then armed with a sharpbladed weapon did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously by means of treachery with abuse of confidence or obvious ungratefulness and with evident premeditation with intent to kill attack assault and use personal violence upon the person of eduardo briones y collado by then and there hitting stabbing and hacking him on different parts of his body thereby inflicting upon him fatal stab wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter contrary to law  during trial prosecution presented two eyewitnesses the spouses clemente and aurelia agne the owners of the house where the incident happened; loida briones the widow of eduardo who testified on the civil aspect of the case; dr pepito bulgos the medico legal officer who testified on the cause of eduardos death; and timoteo alemanthe police officer who conducted the investigation of accusedappellant the defense presented its lone witness the appellant who admitted hacking the victim but invoked selfdefense eyewitness clemente agne testified that appellant sergio briones is an uncle of the victim on may 27 1983 at around 600 oclock pm clemente was in his house with his wife and children when appellant arrived sergio and clemente drank a bottle of gin afterwards eduardo their nephew joined them in the course of their conversation sergio mentioned that he hated sonny brother of eduardoeduardo made a comment which angered sergio who accused eduardo of disrespect towards elders eduardo sat in silence while sergio fuming mad threatened to box eduardo sergio left for home which was twenty meters from clementes house the agne family started to eat dinner eduardo did not join them but remained seated on a chair near the open door with left leg raised his left side towards the door while facing the agne family at a distance of 2 1/2 meters while eating clemente heard a sound glanced sidewards to the door and saw sergio pulling out a bolo from eduardos abdomen thereafter at the blink of an eye sergio hacked eduardo on the left portion of his head with the bolo sergio ran away while eduardo went to the house of councilman bernardo briones another uncle for succor eduardo did not survive the fatal blowsaurelia briones agne wife of clemente and younger sister of appellant as well as the aunt of the victim corroborated clementes testimony on all material points she added that while they were dining she suddenly heard a sound like   tsuk tsuk   coming from where eduardo was upon looking at eduardo she screamed when she saw sergio with a bolo hacking eduardo who was still seated with his left leg raised she saw eduardo hit on his abdomen and on the left of his head immediately sergio and eduardo ran awayloida briones testified that her husband died on may 27 1983 due to wounds caused by stabbing and hacking; that the death caused untoward reverses in all aspects of her life particularly physical and psychological; that she incurred expenses for the wake and interment of her husband in the amount of p854800; that her husband was 24 years old at the time of his death; that he was an operator of a ricemill and was receiving a salary on a commission basis of p25000 a month; and that to supplement his income her husband engaged in poultry and hog raisingmedicolegal officer dr pepito d balgos testified that he conducted the autopsy on the victim eduardo briones on may 28 1983 he testified that eduardo sustained a twoinch incised wound on the abdomen and a oneinch linear fracture on the left temporal bone of the victim eduardo died due to internal hemorrhage caused by the stab wound on the abdomen injuring the inferior vena cavapolice officer timoteo aleman testified that he conducted the investigation on the incident and that appellant surrendered a bolo around 19 inches long with a black handle which appellant identified as the bolo he used in killing eduardo he said appellant first surrendered himself with the bolo to the chief of police who in turn brought him and the bolo to the police station the defenses evidence consisted of the testimony of its lone witness the appellant who interposed selfdefense appellant testified that on may 27 1983 at around 630 oclock in the evening he was at the house of his brotherinlaw clemente agne drinking a bottle of san miguel gin with clemente and two  2  neighbors pedro and pablo villanueva at 700 oclock his nephew eduardo briones arrived and joined them afterwards appellant said eduardo sat down and challenged him  sergio  to a fight for no reason at all when he was about to leave he said eduardo met him tried to grab the bolo from his possession and attempted to attack him clemente pedro and pablo tried to pacify eduardo but the latter did not heed them it was while eduardo was attacking him that appellant said he hacked him sergio then ran away towards their house when he learned that people brought eduardo to the hospital appellant surrendered himself to the station commander of the pnp of aritao nueva vizcaya appellant felt some remorse and later on offered an amicable settlement with the family of the victim he gave p800000 as downpayment but the settlement did not materialize he remembered giving his statement at the police station but claimed that the investigator did not inform him of his constitutional rights in his brief appellant contends that he was able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he acted in selfdefense all the elements of selfdefense were present according to him there was unlawful aggression when the victim challenged him and tried to grab the bolo from him he employed reasonable means in repelling the attack considering that the victim tried to grab the bolo and continued to attack him even though he already moved backward there was no sufficient provocation on his part as it was the victim who challenged him appellant also argues that there was no treachery because a quarrel or heated argument preceded the hacking and stabbing incident for the state the office of the solicitor general  osg  avers that eyewitnesses testified there was no unlawful aggression on the part of eduardo briones the manner spontaneity and demeanor of the two eyewitnesses clemente and aurelia erase any doubt on how appellant killed the victim clemente was a brotherinlaw and aurelia was a sister in full blood to appellant yet the two unflinchingly described the treachery with which appellant thrust his bolo to the unsuspecting eduardo the osg noted that the trial court overlooked the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender it recommends the lowering of the penalty to 14 years 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal as minimum to 20 years of reclusion temporal as maximum facts the first issue is whether there was unlawful aggression the resolution of which rests on the determination of the more credible and acceptable testimony in our view clemente and his wife are more credible than appellant first the eyewitnesses are related to both the accused and the victim we see no reason why they would fabricate an untruth at the expense of one relative second no other witness corroborated the selfserving testimony of appellant he alleged that the villanueva brothers were in the scene yet accused did not present either of them third the spontaneity with which the prosecutions eyewitnesses delivered their testimonies as observed by the trial court obliterates any doubt on their veracity this observation by the trial court is subject to great respect for it was in the best position to make such an estimationappellants invocation of selfdefense is likewise unconvincing the alleged conduct of the victim and his alleged comment concerning disrespect to elders which angered appellant is not a challenge to a fight it is insufficient provocation nor can it be deemed unlawful aggression the victim just sat in silence while the heated argument happenedno fighting words were hurled by the victim by way of provocation further at the time appellant stabbed the victim the latter was relaxing with his left leg raised and conversing with the agne coupleabsent unlawful aggression appellant can not successfully plead selfdefensethe second and third assignment of errors center on whether treachery attended the killing of eduardo two requisites must concur to deem an act treacherous 1  the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and 2  the deliberate and conscious adoption of the means of executionrelevant to the first is our ruling in people vs gasper 225 scra 189  1993  and people vs gupo 190 scra 7  1990  there is no treachery where the attack was preceded by a quarrel and a heated discussion as shown by the testimony of clemente sergio and eduardo had an argument prompted by the latters reply to the formers remark that he hated his nephew sonny sergio berated eduardo for being disrespectful and posed to box the latterafter clemente pacified sergio the latter went home returned with a bolo and attacked eduardo on the second element we note that the prosecution was not able to show that appellant intentionally allowed his brotherinlaw to pacify him so that he could go home get his bolo and attack eduardo however we do not discount the possibility that as soon as sergio left clementes house or as soon as he arrived home he thought of killing eduardo with his bolo clementes house is 20 meters away from appellants house but sufficient proof is wanting to show he had ample time to plot the killing nor that he actually and consciously adopted the means to commit it

homicide, that on or about november 8 1991 in the city of iligan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the said accused armed with a deadly weapon to wit a hunting knife with intent to kill and evident premeditation and by means of treachery did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault stab and wound one apolinario lato thereby inflicting upon the said apolinario late the following physical injuries to wit cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to pneumohamothorax 2o to stabwound 10 cm in depth directed downward medial 3 cm from collarbone  r  side as a result thereof the said apolinario late died evidence for the prosecution the prosecution evidence consisted primarily of the eyewitness account of franklin villamor a 43yearold fruit vendor at the palao supermarket in iligan city whose wife is the sister of the victims own wife villamors fruit stand was around twenty  20  meters away from the cinderella bake shop at about 630 pm of november 8 1991 villamor was on his way to buy bread at said bakeshop he was around two  2  arms length from the bakeshop when he saw appellant   stabbed a person inside the jeepney  the victim who turned out to be apolinario lato his brotherinlaw was then seated at the left side of a tamaraw passenger jeepney a seat away from and behind the drivers seat the jeepney which was bound for taparak had no other passengers on board yet and was parked for the last trip villamor who was then an arms length away from the jeepney saw appellant   stabbed the victim from behind   by thrusting downward to the right side of the victim with his right hand which was holding a knifethe victim was   unaware   of what was about to happen to himupon seeing the stabbing incident villamor chased appellant he was joined by the   bantay ng bayan   a composite unit of the military but after appellant had run towards badelles st villamor stopped and went to the hospital where the victim was brought by the jeepney driver benhur babatido a member of the philippine national police responded to a request for assistance regarding the stabbing incident from civilians with the   bantay ng bayan   with a 5member team and some civilians babatido proceeded to the crime scene where he was informed that the culprit who was identified as the appellant was still in the premises they were able to apprehend appellant of manga baraas upon searching him they recovered a bloodstained hunting knifethey brought appellant to dr uys hospital where he was identified by several persons as the assailant and thereafter to the police headquarters evidence for the defense appellant took the witness stand as the sole witness in his own defense a 38yearold sidewalk vendor he testified that on november 8 1991 at about 630 pm he was mauled and choked by apolinario lato while they were both inside the jeepney bound for taparak as he nearly fell off the jeepney he stabbed lato who was drunk at that time with the knife he carried with him for cutting flowers for sale appellant alleged that at around 700 oclock in the morning of that day appellant had an altercation with the victim who was asking him for money to buy liquor inasmuch as appellant was not able to give him any amount the victim told him   you better watchout   the victim had previously mauled him on november 5 1991 because the victim was much bigger than he was appellant had no chance at all of putting up a defense however appellant whose wife was the sister of the victims wife claimed that he bore the victim no grudges and that vengeance was not his intention the prosecution attempted to establish treachery through the necropsy report the death certificate and the testimony of villamor the said pieces of documentary evidence point to the fact that the victim inflicted a stab wound at the area of the victims collarbone the prosecution claims that the position of said injury was consistent with the testimony of villamor that appellant attacked the victim from behind however upon a closer look at the testimony of villamor we find that it is not clear with respect to the commencement of the attack the pertinent portions of the direct examination of villamor read as follows q at around 630 in the evening of november 8 1991 where were you a i went to cinderilla bake shop to buy bread q were you able to buy bread at cinderilla a not yet because    no sir because i saw him stabbed  sic  a person inside the jeepney q when you say   him   to whom are you referring to a alejandro ocsimar xxx xxx xxx q how did accused alejandro ocsimar stab the victim apolinario lato a alejandro ocsimar stabbed the victim from behind the back of the said victim xxx xxx xxx q when you saw the victim riding on a passenger vehicle please tell the court in what particular place the victim apolinario lato sits  sic  a left side at the back of the drivers seat q you also said that the victim was stabbed behind by the accused will you please demonstrate to the court the manner the accused stabbed the victim in relation to the sitting arrangement of that vehicle court using the interpreter as the deceased and you  witness  as the accused a the witness showed to the court how the deceased was stabbed by the accused by making the following arrangements the table as the inside of the jeepney; and placing the interpreter on a chair directly behind the other chair which is supposedly occupied by the driver; the witness acting as the accused reenacted by getting from behind the interpreter who acted as the deceased; and with his right hand lets say holding a knife made a downward thrust hitting the right side of the interpreter where the deceased was stabbed xxx xxx xxx q did you notice from what you saw    did the victim see the accused when he was stabbed by the accused a he was unaware q how far were you from the place of the stabbing a about one armslength q now when you saw the accused stabbed  sic  the victim from behind did you observe whether the victim was struggling to defend himself a no sir  emphasis supplied  from these portions of villamors eyewitness account it is apparent that he witnessed the actual stabbing of the victim from a distance of an arms length and that the victims being   unaware   of the attack was just villamors own conclusion considering that both the victim and the appellant were his brothersinlaw it is rather surprising and even contrary to human nature that he did not lift a finger to prevent the stabbing incident such inaction is not consistent with appellants quick response right after seeing the stabbing incident he lost no time at all in giving chase to the appellant it is therefore not farfetched to conclude that before the actual attack villamors attention was somewhere else the defense elicited this fact when it crossexamined villamor as follows q will you please tell this court how far were you from the cinderilla bake shop on that day when you mentioned that you allegedly saw the stabbing incident a about two armslength q so you were still on the road a yes q you were still in the road am i right a yes sir q and that since you were still on the road you were actually looking forward your attention was directed forward to the cinderilla bake shop a yes sir q and that at that very moment what was most important to you was your intention to buy bread at cinderilla bake shop a yes sir to be considered as a qualifying circumstance treachery must be proven as clearly as the crime itself treachery cannot be considered where the lone eyewitness did not see how the attack commenced thus where the eyewitness saw the incident already in progress he was not considered as having testified as to how it began consequently even if villamor witnessed the actual stabbing the mere fact that the victim was stabbed at the back did not necessarily make the attack treacherous the fact that appellants act of stabbing lato as witnessed by villamor was the cause of the only injury sustained by the said victim does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that that was the first assault made by appellant upon the victim to repeat treachery must be proved by strong clear and convincing evidence and in the absence thereof all doubts must be resolved in favor of the accused

parricide, that on or about the 18th day of august 2002 in the municipality of malolos province of bulacan philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused with intent to kill his wife anna liza caparasdela cruz with whom he was united in lawful wedlock did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault use personal violence and stab the said anna liza caparasdela cruz hitting the latter on her trunk and on the different parts of her body thereby inflicting upon her serious physical injuries which directly caused her death contrary to law upon arraignment victoriano with the assistance of counsel pleaded not guilty to the offense chargedthereafter trial on the merits ensued in the course of the trial two varying versions arose version of the prosecution joel song  joel  testified that between 330 and 400 pm on august 18 2002 he and two others including the aunt of victoriano were playing a card game known as tongits just three to four arms length away from the latters house while playing joel saw victoriano punching and kicking his wife herein victim anna liza caparasdela cruz anna  in front of their house joel knew the wifes name as   joan   victoriano then dragged anna inside the house by pulling the latters hair then slammed the door joel overheard the couple shouting while they were already inside the housesuddenly victoriano and anna came out of the house together with their young daughter victoriano was behind anna with his arms wrapped around her he asked for joels help joel noticed blood spurting out of annas mouth he took the couples daughter and gave her to victorianos aunt he then went with them to the bulacan provincial hospital  hospital  on board a tricycle however anna diedon the same day at about 630 pm senior police officers 1 condrado umali and eligio jose responding to the call of duty went to the hospital for investigation there victoriano was turned over to the police officers by the hospitals security guard on dutythe certificate of deathprepared by police senior inspector and medicolegal officer dr ivan richard viray  dr viray  showed that victorianos wife died of   hemorrhagic shock as a result of a stab wound trunk   moreover in his medicolegal reportdated august 21 2002 dr viray had the following findings head and neck 1  hematoma frontal region measuring 3 x 3 cm 3 cm right of the anterior midline 2  hematoma left orbital region measuring 2 x 2 cm 3 cm from the anterior midline chest and abdomen 1  stab wound penetrating right shoulder region measuring 2 x 5 cm 2 cm right of the posterior midline about 12 cm deep directed lateralwards and slightly downwards piercing the underlying tissues and muscle lacerating the upper lobe of the right lungs x x x x > there are about 2000 cc of blood and blood clots at the thoracic cavity upper and lower extremities 1  hematoma distal 3rd of the left forearm measuring 7 x 4 cm bisected by its posterior midline with superimposed abrasion measuring 15 x 7 cm along its anterior midline version of the defense victoriano testified that at around 630 pm on august 18 2002 he came home very drunk from a friends house before he could enter their house his wife anna started nagging him saying   hindi ka naman pala namamasada nakipaginuman ka pa   he asked her to go inside their house but she refused thus victoriano slapped anna and dragged her inside their house due to the continuous nagging of anna victoriano pushed her aside so he could go out of the house however she fell on a jalousie window breaking it in the process when he helped her stand up victoriano noticed that her back was punctured by a piece of shattered glass of the jalousie he brought her outside immediately and asked the help of his neighbors who were playing tongits nearby victoriano admitted that joel accompanied him and his wife to the hospital at the hospital victoriano was taken into custody by policemen for questioning it was only in the following morning that victoriano learned of his wifes passing victoriano also testified that he does not usually drink; that he consumed hard liquor at the time of the incident; that anna was not immediately treated in the hospital; that he loved his wife; and that he did not intentionally hurt hervictoriano claims that joels testimony coincides with his own which refers to the slapping incident that occurred outside their house it does not at all point to him as the actual perpetrator of the crime thus victoriano submits that joels testimony is merely circumstantial but circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction as we ruled in people v castillodirect evidence of the commission of the offense is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusions and finding of guilt conviction can be had on the basis of circumstantial evidence provided that  1  there is more than one circumstance;  2  the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and  3  the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt while no general rule can be laid down as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence which will suffice in a given case all the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent and with every other rational hypothesis except that of guilt the circumstances proved should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to only one fair and reasonable conclusion that the accused to the exclusion of all others is the guilty person proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean the degree of proof excluding the possibility of error and producing absolute certainty only moral certainty or   that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind   is requiredin this case we note the presence of the requisites for circumstantial evidence to sustain a conviction first immediately preceding the killing victoriano physically maltreated his wife not merely by slapping her as he claimed but by repeatedly punching and kicking her second it was victoriano who violently dragged the victim inside their house by pulling her hair third in dr virays report anna sustained injuries in different parts of her body due to victorianos acts of physical abuse fourth the location and extent of the wound indicated victorianos intent to kill the victim the report revealed that the victim sustained a fatal stab wound lacerating the upper lobe of her right lung a vital organ the extent of the physical injury inflicted on the deceased manifests victorianos intention to extinguish life fifth as found by both the rtc and the ca only victoriano and anna were inside the house other than their young daughter thus it can be said with certitude that victoriano was the lone assailant sixth we have held that the act of carrying the body of a wounded victim and bringing her to the hospital  as victoriano did  does not manifest innocence it could merely be an indication of repentance or contrition on his partthe foregoing circumstances are proven facts and the court finds no reason to discredit joels testimony and dr virays report besides wellentrenched is the rule that the trial courts assessment of the credibility of witnesses is accorded great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal inasmuch as the court below was in a position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying the court does not find any arbitrariness or error on the part of the rtc as would warrant a deviation from this wellentrenched rule

sariling ama    the old woman told the people inside the emergency room that the boys father — robert cloud — wouldnt allow john albert to come with her and when the boy started to cry and wouldnt stop crying his father began to beat the boy hard tied his hands and made   tusok tusok   in his body the father continued beating the boy even when excrements were already coming out from the boys

sir the defense on the other hand argues that at the time of the commission of the alleged crime appellant was not in his house and that the boy john albert must have fallen from the stairs leading to the second floor of the house the defense presented appellant and he testified that he left the house on the day in question and only learned upon his return that his son was already dead thus q do

hospitalized due to difficulty in breathing as shown by some medical records further presented was the death certificate of john albert cloud issued by one dr gacas and dated august 6 1988 stating that the cause of death was broncho pneumonia with heart complications and the report made by patrolman ulep showing that he investigated the death of the child john albert cloud on this aspect dr alberto m reyes the medical specialist at the nbi who examined the exhumed body of the little boy was presented as a prosecution witness his report indicated   hemorrhage intracranial severe traumatic   as the cause of death he testified that   the upper incisor right was missing contusions on the face right side buttocks knees and on the head and the said injuries could have been caused by a hard blunt object hitting by a fist or a piece of wood   he did give a hypothetical concession   that it was also possible that it was the result of a fall from a building and as result of said injuries the boy suffered internal hemorrhage which was the immediate cause of his death   however as to what would be the more credible cause of death this is what he had to say q in your best judgment as a physician  h is injury could have been caused by any force applied what about the handle of a gun a we do not rule out that possibility q could this finding also with  sic  the result of the excessive of physical hitting  sic  a yes maam court q both buttocks sustained injuries according to your findings a yes right and left side q if baby boy like this boy fall on the high building would sustain injury on the buttocks the injury on the buttocks as well as the knees a the contusion on the buttocks are very extensive they are 20 by 20 centimeters so if the buttocks first  sic  is very different if he falls it is very difficult for him and also on his knees and the knees are anterior portion it is highly improbable fiscal ramos q so as far as the probabilit ies  are concerned are you looking for a possibility that he fell on  sic  a high place a all in all the fall of  sic  a high place is very remot e  against the foregoing facts which came from the lips of these two women who had no ill motives whatsoever against appellant and the circumstantial evidence arising from his abnormal and inexplicable postincident behavior as well as the physical evidence which will hereafter be discussed we have merely the bare denial of appellant and the testimony of his faithful houseboy cum driver herminio acosta since the latter is the star witness of the defense we will consider his testimony in

him a i told him that the child was dead standing out in bold relief from this orchestrated story narrated by acosta for the first time after six years of silence is his clearly deliberate effort to make it appear that appellant his wife and grandmother were not in the house at the time of the incident thus paving the way for him to claim that he alone saw and could testify to what happened to the victim yet comparing his declarations thereon and those of appellant they could not even agree or be specific as to when appellant supposedly left the house and stayed away in paco manila there was not even an attempt on their part to explain why it took more than two hours from the alleged accidental fall from the stairs to take the boy to the hospital which was not a considerable distance away

keep the receipts of the expenses incurred in connection with the death of constancio de mesa  pp 1921 rollo  accusedappellant invokes the justifying circumstance of selfdefense he asserts that it was the victim constancio de mesa jr then allegedly armed with a balisong  fan knife  who initiated the aggression accusedappellants contention carries no persuasive force in the first place both barangay kagawad fredesminda ocfemia and barangay tanod liberato regnim were consistent in their testimony that the victim was unarmed when he was ganged upon by accusedappellant and his equally criminally bent sons both prosecution witnesses likewise testified that while the victim was arguing with accusedappellant william cabiles came out of nowhere and suddenly stabbed the victim at the back with a spear the declarations of ocfemia and regnim totally negate the uncorroborated testimony of accusedappellant that he was attacked by the victim with a balisong in the kitchen of his house moreover said testimony of the two prosecution witnesses utterly nullifies accusedappellants contention that a balisong was found beside the body of the victim in order to selfdefense to prosper the following

murder, the victims in this case jaime amilagan and his brother ernesto amilagan had filed the application for pasturelease agreement no 22449 covering a public land of about 200 hectares in the sitio of daga municipality of coner province of apayao which rogelio t cardenas the acting officerincharge of the bureau of lands had recommended for approval defendants teodorico empe and his wife cecilia archeta as well as their sons aurelio and apolonio empe and their soninlaw jesufin  peping  verdadero in turn held a small parcel of land which the amilagans claim to be within the area covered by their aforementioned application it appears that sometime before december 6 1961 teodorico empe had made a kaingin in said parcel of land in view of which he was on december 6 1961 accused of illegal   kaingin   upon the recommendation of the aforementioned rogelio t cardenas the empes in turn filed a complaint against the amilagans for the destruction of the corn of the former by the cows of the latter apparently these incidents had induced the empes to enclose the area held by them with a barbed wire fence which was broken however by the amilagan brothers on june 11 or 12 1965 in order that their cows could pass through and go to the place where they were scheduled to be branded on june 13 1965 on june 12 1965 at 3 pm as jaime and ernesto amilagan together with pascual contreras aurelio balunsat deogracias de leon federico amilagan and juanita catnae were walking singlefile along a trail passing through a hilly place covered thickly by tall grass coming from the corral of said brothers defendant cecilia archeta stopped them and asked ernesto amilagan why he had destroyed said fence ernesto answered that he had done so to let his cows pass in going to the branding place the next day cecilia then remarked in a loud voice   you are very tough   whereupon aurelio empe emerged from the west side of the trail and forthwith gave jaime amilagan a bolo slash on the left side and forth of the head almost at the same time teodorico empe came out of the tall grasses and immediately swung his bolo at ernesto amilagan who in his attempt to evade the blow tripped over a muddy hole and fell down on his face thereupon aurelio hacked him on the right side of the head similarly teodorico swung his bolo at ernesto whereas cecilia clubbed him on the back and with a bolo slash wounded two  2  of his fingers at this juncture jesufin verdadero and apolonio empe appeared from different directions and swung their respective bolos at ernesto whom jesufin wounded on the upper part of the breast near the thorax and apolonio on the left leg moreover teodorico gave ernesto another bolo slash on the left forearm the amilagan brothers died on the spot due to hemorrhage the defense maintains that the injuries sustained by both had been inflicted by aurelio empe singlehandedly and acting in selfdefense it tried to prove that as aurelio was fetching one of his carabaos which was tied to a tree in the afternoon of the occurrence jaime amilagan came and immediately wounded him with a bolo slash in his left forearm; that thereupon he  aurelio  drew out his bolo and swung it at jaimes head that ernesto amilagan then approached and attacked him with his  ernestos  bolo; that he  aurelio  evaded the bolo slashes given by ernesto and reciprocated the same with his  aurelios  own bolo thereby inflicting several wounds upon ernesto; and that teodorico empe his wife cecilia and their soninlaw jesufin verdadero were then working on the concession of one pacis who was jesufins landlord about two  2  hours walk from the scene of the occurrence furthermore apolonio empe  then below sixteen  16  years of age  testified that after taking his meal on june 12 1965 he went in search of one of his carabaos which he was unable to locate because at about 3 pm sgt taliping came and invited him to go back to his house; that on the way thereto they met aurelio empe who was wounded and drenched in blood and explained that he had been wounded by jaime amilagan; and that thereupon taliping brought him and aurelio to their hut near which they found the dead bodies of two  2  persons in this connection it should be noted that the theory of the defense is based mainly upon the testimony of the defendants whereas the version of the prosecution is supported by the testimony of pascual contreras and deogracias de leon who were with the amilagan brothers at the time of the occurrence and were corroborated by sgt taliping after analyzing the evidence his honor the trial judge in a carefully written decision accepted the version of the prosecution and found that of the defense unworthy of credence indeed the defense maintains that the occurrence was triggered by jaime amilagan who had allegedly attacked aurelio empe and wounded him on the left arm with a bolo sgt taliping positively testified however that when he met aurelio empe that afternoon immediately after the occurrence he did not have any injury in the body then also sgt taliping testified that upon being informed by aurelio balunsat that there had been some killings in the ranch of the amilagans he  taliping  proceeded thereto immediately; that on the way he met apolonio empe whose clothes were stained with blood; that apolonio was moreover carrying a bloodstained bolo; that upon being asked to explain his condition apolonio replied that he his father teodorico his mother cecilia his brother aurelio and his brotherinlaw jesufin verdadero had killed jaime amilagan and ernesto amilagan besides aurelio admitted that the amilagans had no possible reason to try to kill him on the other hand there is ample evidence to the feel that the defendants harbored illfeelings towards the amilagan brothers not only because the latter had succeeded in securing a favorable indorsement of their application for a pasturelease agreement covering an expensive area which included the land held and cultivated by the empes but also because the amilagans had thrown down their  empes  fence apart from seeking their prosecution for illegal   kaingin   the theory of the defense is further weakened by the circumstance that the testimony of the defendants is inherently incredible for apolonio empe would have us believe that he did not even know the names of the two  2  dead persons he found at the scene of the occurrence and that he had never seen them before although they were in fact neighbors  
homicide, aurelio goze his wife zenaida and their children lived in a 3 x 5 house made of wood with bamboo roof in barangay taligan gattaran cagayan the house had an extension called pataguab that had

aurelio was found on a spot that was around thirty  30  meters from the gozes house tagupa observed that there were no trees or other structures obstructing the view of the spot where the body laid as observed from the vantage point of the house in the police investigation appellant told tagupa that he knew   the very person who killed the victim   however tagupa in his testimony to the court admitted that he had already forgotten the name of the supposed assailant mentioned by appellant the following day when tagupa interviewed him once again appellant   withdrew his allegations   claiming that the person he had named was a member of the military and that he was afraid of retaliation appellant did not reveal to tagupa the reason why he was afraid of said member of the military saying that the reason was   confidential  the death certificateshows that 42yearold aurelio goze died of multiple gunshot wounds no autopsy was conducted on the body before burial but it was later

oclock on the night of the killing he was sleeping in the camp/detachment of the military in barangay sidem gattaran cagayan he was told to sleep there by the soldiers on account of threat from new

was awakened by a gunshot at about 1100 in the evening it was a little past 1100 pm when sgts evoco and cavila  sic  arrived with lt ileto the latter gathered the men in the camp and told them to keep quiet and that should anyone inquire about what happened the one who would squeal would be the next victim    isaruno   in ilocano  appellant did not leave the camp until 700 oclock in the morning the next time that appellant saw lt ileto was at around 300 oclock in the afternoon of the day after the commission of the crime when appellant asked him why he killed his cousin lt ileto replied that he was drunk but should anyone file a complaint against him he would pay for the value of the victims lifeappellant admitted that there was a land dispute between him and the victim in fact both of them reported the matter to the agrarian officewhen he was arrested appellant told the arresting office tagupa that someone else had killed aurelio this statement was not reduced into writing because he claimed to be afraid but he promised to tell the truth in court after his release from detention and since no action was taken on the information he had given to tagupa appellant went to governor rodolfo aguinaldo to whom he finally revealed that soldiers were the ones responsible for killing aurelio the governor instructed him to go to the commission on human rights officeappellant executed before the commission an affidavit stating the following that he spent the night at the time of the killing in the pnprsaf detachment in barangay sidem gattaran for fear that members of the npa would raid them; that in the morning he learned that a man had been killed in barangay taligan an adjoining barangay; that when he went home he learned from eduardo suldan and emiterio domingo that they accompanied lt hercules ileto and sgts ebojo and emiterio domingo to the house of one aurelio goze in taligan but suldan and domingo were told by said pnp members to stay fifty  50  meters away from gozes house and that said pnp members then took rogelio from his house and shot him moments later; that in the afternoon of november 3 1991 the people of sidem learned that the pnprsaf was pulling out its detachment; that when lt hercules  sic  saw appellant the former told him not to tell the truth should an investigation be conducted and that lt ileto even executed a certification to the effect that appellant slept in the detachment after learning that he was the suspect in the killingin their joint affidavit emiterio domingo and eduardo suldan attested to the fact that at 800 pm of november 2 1991 they were in the house of barangay captain quirino urata having a drinking spree with lt ileto sgts ebojo and cauilan and other men; that at 1030 pm lt ileto invited them to go with their group; that fifty  50  meters away from the house of aurelio goze they were told to stay behind by lt ileto and sgts ebojo and cauilan who entered the house; that they then saw the three dragging away aurelio and that lt ileto immediately fired at aurelio; that lt ileto and his companions brought them back to the camp where after staying there for about thirty  30  minutes they were told to go homeappellant claims that it took one year three months and twenty days before he reported to the commission on human rights the actual perpetrators of the crime because the soldiers kept on returning to the place and like domingo and suldan he was afraidsuldan confirmed the contents of his affidavit when he testified according to him he was attracted to the house of barangay captain quirino oreta because of people singing there he together with emiterio domingo joined the group that included lt ileto sgts cauilan and ebojo and oreta and his son they had a drinking session later lt iletos group invited them to a house in barangay taligan suldan and domingo were not able to accompany the others to the house because they were told to stay behind two of the soldiers entered the house brought out someone and proceeded to the place where suldan and domingo were left behind lt ileto and his companions proceeded to a certain distance and shot the man who turned out to be aurelio goze from a distance of 20 meters suldan saw lt ileto shoot aurelio thereafter they went back to the camp in barangay sidem where he saw sgt barogan sgt siddayao peralta roger pagaduan ernesto dela cruz fermin espiritu warlito orata and raymundo pagaduan lt ileto then gathered all of them and warned them   not to talk about what happened  edwin abig the barangay captain of taligan heard of the shooting incident from a barangay councilman he immediately reported the incident to the military camp at barangay sidem he went to the crime scene with soldiers to conduct an investigation abig was two  2  meters away when the soldier named sedano who was with sgt cauilan asked the victims wife who killed her husband the wife did not give an answer   because she did not know anything  the following day abig interviewed the wife in front of the chapel where the body of the victim was brought she told him that she did not know who shot her husbandon how the crime was committed zenaida gore testified as follows q at around 1100 oclock in the evening while you and other member s  of your house  sic  do you know if there was any incident that happened a i know sir q what was that a they kicked the door of our house to open sir q after they kicked your door what happened next a they forcibly took my husband sir q to make it clear who forcibly took your husband a the two companions of ernesto de la cruz while he was downstairs sir court q why do you know that ernesto de la cruz was downstairs a i saw him because there was light sir q after the two companions of ernesto de la cruz forcibly took your husband what happened next a they shot him sir q who shot him a ernesto de la cruz shot him first then followed his two companions sir q before this incident happened do you know already ernesto de la cruz a i know him because he is the second degree cousin of my husband sir q if that ernesto de la cruz is in court can you point at him a yes sir  witness pointed to the person who stood up and gave his name ernesto de la cruz  q and if these two other companions of ernesto de la cruz are in court can you point to them a yes sir q are they in court a none sir court proceed fiscal unciano q after ernesto de la cruz and his two other companions shot your husband what happened next a after shooting him they left sirzenaidas simple and straightforward answers to the questions bespeak of an honest intention to reveal the truth this explains why the trial court found her a credible witness and gave her testimony full faith and credit nevertheless to satisfy questions on zenaidas credibility and that of her testimony each and every contention of appellant in his brief shall be discussed in assailing her credibility appellant capitalizes on the following portion of her testimony q is it not a fact that you are pointing ernesto de la cruz because you dont like him or hate him a yes sir because we have a land dispute court proceed fiscal unciano q and because of this land dispute you are pointing at him as one who killed your husband a i saw him sir q why do you say that a he was always quarrelling my husband before because of that land dispute sir italics supplied  appellant asserts that zenaida could not have seen what she claimed she saw because she was very nervous to prove this point appellant quotes this portion of her crossexamination q and at that time you were frightened and you went for a personal necessity and you immediately urinatethere in your urinating pan a yes sirbut the fact that the witness was gripped with fear does not prove he failed to recognize the assailantsnow to the issue of illumination of the crime scene appellant asserts that while zenaida testified that the house was already lighted she subsequently testified that she lighted a lamp thereby contradicting her first statement the issue of illumination of the crime scene or visibility is indeed indispensable in the identification of a criminal offenderhowever contrary to appellants allegation it was established without contradiction that there was sufficient light to enable zenaida to recognize appellant zenaida testified that their house was lighted when two intruders kicked open its door the same light allowed her to recognize appellant who was downstairswhen the court asked her what she did when appellant and his two companions brought out her husband and she answered that she lighted a gas lampit did not necessarily imply that the house was previously unlighted zenaidas answer to the courts question should be considered in light of her testimony on crossexamination that she lighted another lamp which she placed opposite the stairshowever when the intruders dragged her husband downstairs she took with her the original gas lampthat zenaida was able to recognize appellant by the light of the gas lamp is not farfetched this court has ruled that illumination produced by a kerosene lamp like a   gasera   or   lampara   is sufficient for the identification of personsidentification was likewise facilitated by the fact that zenaida was familiar with the features of appellant who was her husbands cousin thus in one case the court held that the distance of 40 to 45 meters of the witness from the crime scene taken by itself may lead the court to entertain doubts on the accuracy of what a witness has observed but once a person has gained familiarity with another identification becomes quite an easy task even from a considerable distancethat the crime transpired at night is immaterial because zenaida first saw appellant when he was barely two  2  meters away from her it was therefore unnecessary for the defense to belabor the point that the crime happened outside the lighted house under a moonless night in an effort to contradict zenaidas testimony regarding the position of the moon in relation to herin fact appellant for the first time submitted before this court a certification from the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration  pagasa  to the effect that at 1100 pm of november 2 1991   there was no moon in the sky for an observer situated at brgy taligan gattaran cagayan   because the last quarter occurred at 310 pm on october 30 1991 and the new moon at 711 pm on november 6 1991suffice it to say that to admit that certification as a piece of evidence this late in the proceedings would be most unfair to the prosecution which was not given an opportunity to examine its contents and rebut them the rules of court and jurisprudence decree that    t he court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offeredbut even if we are to take judicial notice of the laws of nature as evidenced by the certificationthe fact is moon or no moon the witness identified accused as the assailant by other means to the satisfaction of the court zenaida was thus able to observe how her husband was shot at a distance of thirty  30  meters with only the light from the gas lamp aiding her vision she testified that as soon as the malefactors had taken her husband to a distance of around thirty meters from their house appellant shot him and appellants companions followed suit no one of the three malefactors most especially appellant even tried to dissuade his companions from committing the crime zenaidas unrebutted testimony consequently proves beyond a shadow of doubt that conspiracy attended the commission of the crime for conspiracy to exist it is not required that there be an agreement for an appreciable period prior to the occurrence; it is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense all the accused had the same purpose and were united in its executionwhere the acts of the accused collectively and individually demonstrate the existence of a common design towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful purpose conspiracy is evidentappellant contends that there are   too many blanks   in zenaidas testimonyhe argues that despite the intrusion of armed men into their house and the abduction of her husband the fact that she remained inside her house and waited until morning before attending to the body of her dead husband strengthens the proposition that she could not have seen how the crime was perpetrated in support of his contention that zenaida could not have observed the commission of the crime appellant argues that the extension of the house called pataguab was an enclosed placethat contention however is not supported by evidence appellant merely inferred it from zenaidas testimony that the extension had a door distinct from the door of the main househowever if appellants penchant for inferences were to be pursued it is not remote to similarly infer that the extension might have had an   entrance   that was not necessarily blocked by a door or that its wall would not obstruct the view outside the house on account of the established fact that the gozes kitchen had no wallszenaidas behavior of leaving her husband unattended after he was shot is not contrary to human experience and would not necessarily imply that she did not see her husband being shotnot every witness to a crime can be expected to act reasonably and conformably to the expectations of everyonedifferent persons have different reactions to similar situations as the defense insinuated at the trial zenaida could not have positively identified appellant because she was then so nervous that she even urinated a nervewracking experience would not necessarily cause blockage of vision on the contrary the witness would focus his attention on the unusual occurrence creating an indelible impression in the mind that the witness can recall vividlyzenaidas failure to go down to the yard to attend to her husband after he was shot was not without reason she naturally feared for her life and those of her children that she opted to remain inside her house that no complaint was lodged against appellants companions despite zenaidas certainty that she could recognize them does not affect her credibilityfailure of the police and the prosecution to apprehend the malefactors should not be taken against zenaida it was not her fault that appellants companions have remained at large the question of whether or not she in fact revealed the identities of the malefactors when the barangay captain and the soldiers went to her house the day after the commission of the crime is a matter that was sufficiently proved during trial zenaida testified to the effect that she informed the investigating authorities that appellant was one of the perpetrators of the crime if indeed she kept mum about the identity of her husbands killer that was not an unnatural reaction fear for ones life is a valid explanation for a witness failure to immediately notify the authorities of the identity of the malefctors such failure does not necessarily affect much less impair the credibility of the witnessat any rate spo4 franklin tagupa would not have a reason to investigate appellant the day after the commission of the crime if zenaida had not in fact revealed his identity as one of the malefactors the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not established there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons employing means methods or forms in the execution thereof which directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might maketwo things must be proved 1  the employment of means of execution that gives the victim no opportunity to present a defense; 2  the means and mode of attack must be consciously adoptedtreachery cannot be presumed it is necessary that the existence of the qualifying circumstance should be proven as fully as the crime itselfin the case at bar there is no proof that the execution or mode of attack was consciously adoptedaccording to the testimony of the widow the armed men were first looking for rice before they barged into their house it is therefore possible that the decision to shoot the victim was a spur of the moment resolution sudden and unexpected in view of the paucity of evidence to prove the contrary this court cannot sustain a finding of the existence of treachery

1994 that before her death arlene was in her employ sonia testified that the pain caused by the death of her daughter arlene could not be compensated and that arlene left a child whom sonia has to care for testifying as the sole defense witness accused dimailig 27 years old asserted that arlene was his girlfriend they first met on november 21 1991 when she bought pandesal from the bakery owned by accused dimailig located in novaliches accused dimailig asked her address intending to write to her when he leaves for kuwait arlene obliged him but did not inform him that she was married and a

called her   mama   or   sweetheart   and she sent him letters pictures and cards accused dimailig went to kuwait stayed there for a year and returned to the country on july 9 1993 at this time he discovered that arlene was married but separated from her husband and had a child with her husband he was uncertain if arlene and her husband had the intention of reconciling with each other however he knew that arlene often talked to her husband and that she met with him several times at around 400 in the afternoon of october 3 1993 he was at the office of exponent in buendia applying for work abroad he left at 430 pm and proceeded directly to the northmall shopping center to tell arlene that he would be leaving for jeddah when he disembarked at the lrt station he saw a crowd milling around

twenty  20  people hit his face and chest making him lose consciousness he regained consciousness at the kalookan general hospital where two policemen brought him afterwards he was taken to the police station he claimed that the policemen failed to inform him of his constitutional rights he said that he did not give any statement to the police admitting to the crime he also denied being identified by josephine sevillana at the police headquarters he declared his love for arlene guaves and reiterated that he could never commit the murder for which he was charged with in his brief accusedappellant dimailig questioned the credibility of witness josephine sevillana and stated that her testimony was replete with inconsistencies he pointed out that josephine first declared that arlene and accused appellant had a relationship but later changed her answer to the effect that she did not know if indeed they had a relationship thereafter she testified that she did not know anything about it accusedappellant also imputed doubt as to whether josephine was actually present at the northmall on the day of the stabbing and witnessed the attack against the victim he alleged that josephine was inconsistent in describing the manner in which the deceased arlene was stabbed for she initially declared that accused blocked their way and pulled arlene before stabbing her then later testified that accusedappellant attacked them from behind josephines testimony on the relationship between accusedappellant and the victim arlene guaves is credible she knew accusedappellant was courting her sister but she did not know if the two became sweethearts indeed josephine could be expected only to testify on matters that were evident to her; she could not be expected to testify on a relationship that she was not privy to a witness can testify only on facts which he knows of his own personal knowledge  
homicide, at ten o clock in the evening of 20 august 1992 at zone 9 macanhan carmen cagayan de oro city m/sgt estefanio c anobling was in his yard from there he saw carlito cortez playing billiards with an unidentified person a meter away stood gerry espa and another unidentified person they were about six  6  meters away from anobling carlito jerry and the two  2  john does appeared to be exchanging glances and signals that anobling decided to place them under surveillance about fortyfive  45  minutes later dominador bislig and his nephew ismael ledesma arrived at the neighboring store ledesma ordered beer upon seeing bislig and ledesma the four  4  accused went inside the house of vicky a neighbor of anobling and further observed bislig and ledesma from there some five  5  meters away according to anobling the accused   waiv ed  their hands pointing to bislig and his nephew  cortez then approached the two  2  and conversed with them while they talked gerry espa would join them now and then apprehensive anobling went to the store to make sure that no untoward incident would happen as he approached ledesma and bislig the latter offered anobling a softdrink anobling accepted the offer as it was already past midnight anobling asked them to leave before they disturb the neighborhood and bislig promised to do so after finishing his beer with that promise anobling returned home shortly after he overheard one  1  of the four  4  accused ask ismael ledesma where he was going to which ledesma replied that he was accompanying dominador bislig home anobling again rushed out of his house taking the street parallel to where the accused were he saw accused carlito cortez and gerry espa four  4  meters away holding bislig by his coat then cortez stabbed bislig with a knife while one of the   john does   held a jungle bolo upon seeing anobling one of the assailants shouted   si master si master    and the four  4  fled anobling chased them and apprehended the man wielding the bolo and disarmed him although he was able to escape later anobling returned to bislig and helped him into a motorcab that took him to the hospital meanwhile the people milling around the crime scene told anobling that the culprits were still holding out in the house of gilbert cortez carlitos brother anobling proceeded to that house with barangay kagawad lando coro and apprehended carlito cortez who was pretending to be asleep and gerry espa who was standing in the yard dr apolinar vacalares who autopsied the body of dominador bislig testified that the victim sustained two  2  stab wounds one  1  located at the front anterior chest measuring 55 cm in length and the other at the backside below the right scapula 3 cms long cause of death was   massive hemopneumothorax due to stab wound   meaning that the stabbing caused a puncture in the lung that filled the thoracic cavity with blood the doctor also testified that the front wound was caused by   a sharp with three edges rectangular knife  while the back wound was caused by a knife   with three edges and were rounded  he also opined that based on the nature and shape of the wounds it was possible that they were caused by two  2  different weapons accusedappellant carlito cortez testified in his defense he claimed that on the night of the incident he was asleep in the house of his brother gilbert cortez in macanhan carmen where he also lived it was only some fifty  50  meters away from the crime scene according to him he spent the whole day taking care of his brothers child and was only awakened by noise at midnight gerry espa for his part stated that he arrived at the house of gilbert cortez at eleven oclock in that evening to fetch carlito because they were going to do routine surveillance in a nearby barangay as barangay tanods gilbert cortez testified that on the night of the incident he arrived home from work at about eight oclock in the evening he had supper with his wife and children together with his brother carlito cortez after which they all went to sleep at about eleven oclock gerry espa arrived to fetch carlito he  gilbert  was about to wake carlito up when anobling and a certain kagawad lando coro arrived to arrest carlito and gerry in fact a minor altercation ensued but the two  2  were prevailed upon to go to the police station and they did quietly in their fourpage brief accusedappellants argue that the trial court erred   in giving credence to the testimony of the prosecutions alleged lone eyewitness m/sgt estefanio anobling who was merely attempting to make himself look important like claiming to have been orally designated by mayor pablo p magtajas to take care of the peace and order of barangay macanhan cagayan de oro city   accusedappellants invoke alibi but the positive identification of the accused where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter prevails over alibi and denialfurthermore for the defense of alibi to prosper it must be established by positive clear and satisfactory proof that  a  the accused was somewhere else when the offense was committed and  b  it was physically impossible for the accused to have been present at the scene of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commissionif there was even a chance for the accused to be present at the crime scene the alibi will not holdcarlito cortez testified that he was in his brothers house sleeping at the time the incident occurred gerry espa testified that he arrived at the house at eleven oclock in the evening however the house is only fifty  50  meters away from the crime scene hence the defense of alibi is unavailing since the presence of both men in that house did not necessarily preclude their presence at the locus criminis it becomes even less plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by accusedappellants themselves and their immediate relativesthe defense attempted to corroborate the testimony of the two  2  accusedappellants by presenting gilbert cortez while ordinarily relationship per se does not affect the credibility of a witness in this case the court believes that gilbert cortez was highly biased in favor of his brother indeed blood relatives tend to be naturally protective of each other and are not above giving false testimonies in favor of one another especially a relative in danger of being convicted hence gilberts testimony although prompted by understandable reasons is entitled to very little weight and cannot prevail over the positive unbiased testimony of anobling accusedappellants endeavor to assail the credibility of prosecution witness anobling in their brief they stated that   ncounsels own assessment of m/sgt estefanio c anobling he is nothing but a braggart he is used to blowing his own horn or patting his own back as no one else did   they even went as far as to state that the witness   exudes the appearance of a multiple familied ignoramus   such argumentum ad hominem only serves to emphasize the lack of merit of the cause of the defense however even if defense counsel is partially correct this is merely his own assessment and is not supported by any evidence on record in fact all defense witnesses including the two  2  accusedappellants admitted that anobling did not bear any grudge against them nor was there any bad blood between them when there is no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why a prosecution witness would falsely testify against an accused or implicate him in a heinous crime his testimony is worthy of full faith and creditaccusedappellants likewise point out the following inconsistencies in the testimony of anobling  a  if indeed he ran parallel to the road taken by the assailants he would not have caught up with them and would not have recognized them because it was dark;  b  the assailant he caught could not have escaped since according to him he was a black belt in karate;  c  he was lying when he said he knew carlito cortez before the incident because he mistakenly called him   sander   which is actually the nickname of carlitos brother alexander; and  d  if carlito was pretending to be asleep in the room in the second floor of his brothers house then gerry espa should have also been with him pretending to sleep and not out in the yard they also raise the argument that the bolo that anobling recovered from the unidentified assailant could not have been the weapon that caused the fatal wound lastly accusedappellants contend that the bolo m/sgt anobling presented in court was not the one used to stab dominador bislig they rely on the testimony of the examining pathologist dr apolinar vacalarez  q doctor you have described the wounds inflicted on the alleged victim could you tell the court doctor if it is possible that this weapon could have caused the wound inflicted on the alleged victim x x x a may i have the bolo x x x x in the drawing there are three edges meaning that the wounding instrument had three  3  sides but this one  bolo  one edge is only sharp and one side is dull and the tip of the bolo is dull and it is slippery to my mind this is not the weapon the testimony of anobling although sufficient to prove that accusedappellants did indeed kill dominador bislig is nevertheless wanting as far as proof of treachery is concerned fiscal quilisado were you able to catch dominador bislig m/sgt anobling i was about  4  meters away because i was able to see sander thrust his knife to dominador bislig on the left chest q who is this sander you are referring to a its carlito cortez and his nickname or   angga   is sander q what were the three other accused doing while a certain   sander   stabbed dominador bislig a this carlito cortez or   sander   was holding dominador bislig by the coat because dominador bislig is  sic  wearing a coat at that time q what about the accused gerry espa what was he doing a this gerry espa was holding dominador bislig on his coat while the other one is  sic  holding a jungle bolo anobling testified indeed that carlito cortez whom he knew as   sander   stabbed dominador bislig but as to the specific manner of stabbing its degree of swiftness or suddenness or any indication that treachery was present no specific details were provided nowhere did anobling state that the attack was swift or sudden or of such a nature that the victim was deprived of the opportunity to defend himself neither was it clear whether espas participation constituted treachery anobling merely stated that gerry espa was holding the victim when he was stabbed he did not state for certain that espa immobilized bislig to give cortez the opportunity to stab bislig without exposing himself to danger the witness related that espa held the victim only by the coat therefore it did not necessarily follow that he was completely deprived of the chance to defend himself neither did anobling state that espa was already holding bislig when cortez stabbed him hence a reasonable possibility existed that although espa held bislig simultaneous to the stabbing this did not automatically mean that his holding the victim was consciously or deliberately employed to insure the killing to establish evident premeditation there must be proof of  a  the time when the accused determined to commit the crime;  b  an overt act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination to commit the crime; and  c  the lapse of a sufficient period of time between the determination and the execution of the crime to allow the accused an opportunity to reflect upon the consequences of the actnone of these elements was proved by the prosecution anobling saw the four  4  accused going inside the house of vicky upon seeing bislig and his nephew he also saw them making suspicious gestures however we could only speculate as to what went on inside the house of vicky and what those gestures actually meant whether these could be taken as indicia of premeditation could not be seen merely from anoblings testimony thus there was no direct proof of evident premeditation or that accusedappellants plotted in advance to liquidate bislig neither could abuse of superior strength be appreciated abuse of superiority is present whenever there is inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor and selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crimethere was no showing that accusedappellants took advantage of their number in order to overpower the victim in anoblings testimony nothing was known of the unidentified mens participation in the affray except that one of them was holding a jungle bolo at the time of the incident this leaves only two  2  active aggressors the two  2  accusedappellants cortez and espa their number could not have constituted abuse of superior strength the prosecution and the lower court seem to have overlooked the fact that dominador bislig was not alone when he was attacked ismael ledesma told anobling that he was going to accompany bislig to his house it was even possible that he could have sustained several blows before fleeing the presence of ledesma precluded the possibility of abuse of superior strength because then the assailants would not be superior in number to the victim

grabbed him from behind and accused him of snatching a necklace he was brought to the malibay detachment and made to answer for the murder charge appellant further alleged that nena flores testified against him because of a dispute between her husband bienvenido flores and his brother felizardo mejos which transpired ten  10  years ago bienvenido flores was convicted for stabbing felizardo carla mejos teresita velasco and delia fuentes corroborated the testimony of appellant they all claimed that appellant was in bulacan the whole afternoon of october 30 1992 the issues boil down to the credibility of nena flores and edgar ribo the eyewitnesses to the crime appellant insists that nena flores is a biased witness her prejudice allegedly stemmed from the conviction of her husband for stabbing felizardo mejos a brother of appellant ten  10  years ago nena flores denied any knowledge about the alleged stabbing incident even assuming that her husband stabbed appellants brother the evidence is insufficient to show that nena flores still harbored illfeelings against appellant after the lapse of ten  10  years it ought to be noted that the incident did not involve appellant himself who was only fifteen  15  years old at that time to be sure a perusal of the records will not yield any trace of bias in the testimony of nena flores her story is consistent and full of minute details she testified q what happened madam witness while you and nanette cartajena were sitting at the brgy outpost a nanette cartajena was seated at my left side and i noticed max mejos approaching with a knife q how far was max mejos when you first saw him a about five  5  arms length q from what direction did he come from a from our left side q what did you do when you noticed max mejos

during that time madam witness a while i was  on  board the pedicab i look ed  back and i saw max mejos continue to stab nanette cartajena who was pleading   tama na tama na   but max mejo did not cease to stabbed  sic  nanette until she fell down q to what place did you proceed a to the detachment q were you able to reach the police detachment a no more maam because i was able to meet the

cartajena and he was able to overtake her q so what did you and the police officer and the father of nanette do after nanette cartajena was being stabbed by the accused max mejos x x x x x x x x x a they immediately proceeded to the place and chased max mejos but they were not able to catch him     flores could not have contrived her story she identified appellant as the malefactor two  2  hours after the incident geronides corroborated the story of flores in a sworn statement similarly given to the police we further stress that appellants conviction rests not only on the testimony of nena flores but also on the testimony of eyewitness edgar ribo ribo a security guard heard how the victim begged for her life while appellant was stabbing her to death he gave his eyeball account to the police at 935 am on october 31 1992 less than twentyfour hours after the killing the relevant portion of his sworn statement reads 06 t nasaan ka naman nang mangyari ang insidente na iyong sinasabi s

harbors any illmotive against appellant it is not expected that a witness would prevaricate and cause the criminal conviction of one who brought him no harm or injury we cannot sustain appellants alibi in view of his positive identification by credible eyewitnesses although his alibi was corroborated by three  3  witnesses which include his wife and his sister we find no cogent reason to disturb the trial judges rejection thereof considering the ease of its fabrication by virtue of visual advantage during the proceedings the conclusions of the trial judge as to credibility of witnesses deserve our respect moreover appellants alibi does not inspire credence per his testimony appellant was in bulacan for a span of four  4  years from 1989 until 1992 he claimed he was fetched by his wife because their son was seriously ill and was confined at the san lazaro hospital in tayuman manila they took a baliwag bus and alighted at grace park in kalookan from kalookan they boarded a baclaran bound passenger jeepney upon reaching libertad pasay city they took another jeepney going to malibay appellant was allegedly arrested shortly after he and his wife alighted at the philtranco terminal if appellant and his wife alighted at grace park kalookan and took a baclaran bound jeepney the same would pass by san lazaro hospital yet they did not drop by the hospital to visit their supposed seriously ill child they continued with their trip to pasay until they finally reached malibay they parted ways in malibay to enable appellant to go to san lazaro hospital which they had already passed by the circuitous route followed by appellant strains credulity we now come to the characterization of the crime at bar it is a settled rule that a circumstance which could qualify the killing to murder must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself we hold that the trial court erred in appreciating the circumstance of abuse of superior strength the fact that the victim was a woman does not by itself establish that appellant committed the crime with abuse of superior strength there ought to be enough proof of the relative strength of the aggressor and the victim abuse of superior strength can be appreciated only when there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor it contemplates a situation of strength notoriously selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime nor was evident premeditation duly proved nothing in the records show that appellant planned in advance the commission of the crime at bar neither can treachery be appreciated against appellant the victim was aware of the attack against her she was even able to flee albeit briefly from her attacker finally it was not shown that appellant consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means methods and forms in the axecution of the crime

stairs they were startled to see three  3  persons scampering out of the door that leads to an alley located beside the grocery aided by the light coming from the fluorescent lamp of a jewelry and watch repair shop located across the said doortony choi readily identified the three  3  men as junjun who went out first followed by rodrigo maliput and undo daprosa the last two  2  were his employees while junjun was his former employee instinctively tony choi hurriedly went down to reach for the switch near the exit door and turned on the lights tony and his wife were shocked to see the

neighbors tony shouted   pete ro ri tatang ku ampo i ma ku    kapampangan for   they killed my father and mother   tonys neighbors responded to his call and one of them named cely volunteered to call the police meanwhile tony promptly went to the apartment he maintains for his employees in del pilar st  also in san fernando  to check on the whereabouts of maliput and daprosa but they were not in

his men to fetch the said employees from the places where they lived and to bring them to the grocery for identification and questioning in the lineup that ensued tony choi as well as the other workers informed cruz that three  3  names in the list were not present thereat namely alex jumawan  also known as daprosa  rodrigo maliput and a former employee named junjun cruz then ordered his men to locate jumawan and maliput in their known addresses his men however came back empty handed save for information obtained from neighbors they interviewed ie that thirty  30  minutes before their arrival jumawan rodrigo maliput and junjun were seen leaving together with all their belongings acting on the information that junjun one of the suspects was residing at malabanan angeles city spo4

that should he persist he would finish the latter  yayariin kita  junjun eventually left the grocery and worked in angeles city for the next two years maliput averred that when he and jumawan refused to join junjun in his plan the latter left but threatened them not to report to the police or else he would come back and kill both of them fearing for their lives he and jumawan decided to pack their

homicide, the facts on august 17 1996 there was a benefit dance held at the barangay hall of meohao kidapawan cotabato the dance ended at 1230 am the following day leolito attended the dance on august 18 1996 at around 100 am leolito who just came from the dance was seen by prosecution witness remegia obenza  hereinafter referred to as   remegia    with accusedappellant arnold gonzales on a bench outside her storeleolito was asleep on the bench presumably it was while he was sleeping that someone with a dagger snuffed out his life there were no eyewitnesses to the actual stabbing the prosecution thus had the task of knitting the pieces of evidence together into a thriving whole an accusing finger was pointed at gonzales as he was the last person seen with leolito before he was stabbed dead on august 18 1996 a postmortem examination was conducted on leolitos body we quote the relevant parts of the report  pertinent findings   chest and back multiple stab wounds on the right anterior chest on the level of 2nd intercostal space midclavicular line measuring 4 cms in lenght  sic  and 4 ins in depth; 3rd ics mcl measuring 3 cms in lenght  sic  and 4 ins in depth; on the left anterior chest on the level of the 2nd and 3rd ics parasternal area measuring 5 cms in lenght  sic  and 4 ins in depth; and on the sternal area lower 3rd measuring 2 cms in lenght  sic  stab wound on the thoracolumbar area measuring 2 cms in lenght  sic  and 2 ins in depth   cause of death acute blood loss secondary to multiple stab wounds    1  shortly after the crime was committed gonzales admitted to a certain juny habla that he stabbed the victim prosecution witness juny habla testified that on august 18 1996 at around 200 am gonzales came to his house at palusok muaan kidapawan city he was wearing a bloodied shirt in the presence of junys brother and sister gonzales admitted that he stabbed leolito gonzales requested juny to accompany him to the house of a certain egoy cornejo to surrenderjunys testimony should not be disregarded true the records do not show whether juny was a confidant or close friend of gonzales however we note that admissions as evidenceneed not be made only to close friends the utterance could have very well been a part of the res gestaeit is not uncommon for one who is confronted with a startling occurrence to panic and seek the help of an acquaintance or even a stranger while it is a wonder why one would make such an incriminating confession to a stranger it is more incredible for one with no motive or feelings of illwill to testify falsely against another incriminating him in a grievous crimewhen there is no showing that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by an improper motive the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is thus entitled to full faith and creditit is equally important to note that junys testimony was unrebutted and that cross examination was waived by the defensethe defense could have questioned the veracity of the testimony having failed to do so junys testimony which the trial court correctly considered as credible stands unscathed 2  gonzales was the last person to be seen with the victim before he died remegia categorically stated that shortly before the victim was stabbed she saw gonzales with leolito on a bench outside her store true mere presence at the scene of the crime is not tantamount to guilthowever this is not the only circumstance availing here we recall the case of people v santosthere we affirmed the conviction of the accused on the basis of circumstantial evidence there two of the four compelling linkswere that  1  the accused were the last persons seen with the victim as it is so in the case at bar and  2  there were police officers who testified on the conditions of the accused at the time of arrest conditions which indicated their guilt again a circumstance present in this case  3  upon discovering that the victim had died  from the stab wounds  gonzales uttered a statement displaying apathy inconsistent with innocence remegia also testified that she heard gonzales trying to wake the victim she heard gonzales say to another   patay na na patay na na mo report lang ko ugma    he is already dead i will just report it tomorrow the indifferent and unperturbed tenor of the statement is significant it is not normal for one who innocently chances upon a dead man lying in his own pool of blood to nonchalantly shrug it off and announce that he   will just report  it  tomorrow   such apathy is inconsistent with innocence facts or circumstances that are consistent with guilt and are inconsistent with innocence constitute evidence with weight and probative forceremegia heard gonzales speak she knew gonzales since he was a boy she was familiar with him and could identify him by the mere sound of his voice expertise in voice identification is not necessary reliance on ones sense of hearing and recollection suffices 4  police officers spo1 espadera and spo3 salmorin testified that when they arrested gonzales he was wearing a bloodstained shirtneither may the testimonies of spo1 espadera and spo3 salmorin be ignored no proof of bias or ill motive to falsely implicate gonzales was shown furthermore credence should be accorded to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who are law enforcersthe well entrenched rule is that assessment of the credibility of witnesses is within the province of the trial court it is the trial court and not this court that had the opportunity to observe the witnesses manner of testifying their furtive glances calmness sighs or their scant or full realization of their oaths spo3 salmorin was not crossexamined by the defenseand the statements he thus uttered were not rebutted a persons silence particularly when it is persistent may justify an inference that he is not innocentthe trial court was more inclined to believe the prosecution absent any arbitrariness or gross mistake so should we the nonpresentation of the bloodstained shirt in evidence being merely corroborative of other evidence on record is not fatal to the prosecutions case sec 4 rule 133 of the revised rules of court provides  sec 4 circumstantial evidence when sufficient  circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if    a  there is more than one circumstance;    b  the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven and    c  the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt   in our mind the four aforementioned circumstances form an unbroken chain of events leading to one fair conclusionthat gonzales perpetrated the crime a degree of proof excluding all possibility of error is not required to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt absolute certainty is not required only moral certainty is in this case the evidence meets a degree of proof sufficient to produce conviction in an unprejudiced mindaccuseds defense is alibi and denial gonzales defense is alibi and denial the weakest of all defensesgiven the straightforward candid and positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the negative testimony of gonzales the positive testimonies must prevail

asked him who shot him but he did not answer that they got a tricycle to take him to the hospital; that while on board the tricycle the victim was again asked who shot him but the latter could not answer anymore he declared that he did not recall seeing arevalo and valenzuela at lindogs house or anywhere near julian de silvaspo1 romeo magtipon spo2 jesus balliaber and spo2 andres octavio who were presented by the defense as hostile witnesses testified that they investigated the incident and took in the appellants for questioning spo2 balliaber declared that the place of occurrence was dark and that there were no lights in the area spo1 magtipon and spo2 octavio declared that they brought the appellants to the crime laboratory at the provincial headquarters in sta cruz laguna for a paraffin test but the office was closed so no test was done it is extant from the records that the entirety of the prosecutions case rests upon the identification of the appellants as the culprits made verbally to vivencio arevalo and dominador valenzuela by julian de silva shortly before he died from the gunshot wounds fatally inflicted upon him consequently it is imperative to determine if the alleged ante mortem statement made by the victim was correctly received as a dying declaration in accordance with the rules of court and also since said statement was testified to by vivencio arevalo and dominador valenzuela to carefully consider the latters testimony and ascertain whether credit should be accorded them if at all appellants contend that it was erroneous for the trial court to rely on the ante mortem statement of julian de silva which he gave to vivencio arevalo and dominador valenzuela pointing to appellants as his assailants they raise the following points for our consideration  a  the place where the incident took place was dark;  b  the wounds sustained by the victim were fatal such that his speech faculty was affected and he was rendered unconscious;  c  the testimony of benedicto llanes to the effect that when the victim was asked by his nephew oggie de silva as to who shot him the victim did not reply; and  d  while being brought to the medical clinic the victim made no answer when asked by his relatives about the identity of his assailants the foregoing points for consideration are not without explanations while the place of occurrence was dark it was not dark enough to prevent the victim from identifying his assailants especially so that he was shot at close range the precision of the shots betrays the proximity of the assailants from the victim when the shots were fired indeed the assailants were close enough for the victim to get a good look at them and identify them even if the wounds sustained by the victim were fatal dr cynthia tamares testified that it was possible for the victim to have remained conscious after he was shotit is plausible therefore that the victim was able to recognize his assailants and reveal their identity to arevalo and valenzuela whom he knew to be barangay tanods before he lost consciousness appellants would capitalize on the declaration of benedicto llanes that oggie de silva was the first to respond to the victim when the latter appeared at the yard of lindogs house asking for help and when oggie asked the victim who shot him he did not answer we quote benedicto llanes testimony q will you please name the nephew who first came to the aide  sic  of julian de silva a oggie de silva sir q after oggie de silva held julian de silva what happen  sic  next if there was any a oggie de silva asked the victim who shot at him q what was the reply if there was any by julian de silva a none sir q how many times do you heard  sic  oggie de silva asked  sic  julian de silva regarding the question a i heard only once q after julian de silva failed to answer the question of oggie de silva what happen  sic  next if there was any a i left and proceeded home x x x x x x x x x q aside from oggie do you know if there are  sic  other persons who approached julian de silva a none sir q it was only the nephew of the victim oggie de silva who approached julian de silva a its only he whom i saw because i left immediately q how long did you stay in the place of the incident from the time that julian de silva arrived a around half a minute q you mean to say at about half a minute from the arrival of julian de silva you left the place to get a tricycle a yesthe credibility of benedicto llanes is very much doubtful since according to him it was oggie de silva who asked the victim who shot him it is oggie who should have been presented to testify on what was the victims response no explanation was advanced why oggie was not placed on the witness stand on the other hand it stands to reason that it was vivencio arevalo being a tanod who first asked the victim who shot him since the victim had already answered that appellants did it it was superfluous for oggie to have asked the same question assuming that oggie was really present at the scene besides benedicto llanes by his own admission left the victims side half a minute after the latter sought help so that benedicto could not have heard what the victim told the two barangay tanods arevalo and valenzuela after he  benedicto  left to get his tricycle appellants assignment of errors are basically anchored on the issue of credibility but the timehonored rule of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand must again be stressed the trial judge is the best and the most competent person who can weigh and evaluate the testimony of witnesses his firsthand look at the declarants demeanor conduct and attitude at the trial places him in a peculiar position to discriminate between the true and the false consequently appellate courts will not disturb the trial courts findings save only in cases where arbitrariness has set in and disregard for the facts important to the case have been overlookedhere we find no compelling reason to depart from this rule the guilt of herein appellants has been established beyond reasonable doubt the testimonies of arevalo and valenzuela to julian de silvas dying declaration were both given in a categorical convincing and straightforward manner besides it does not appear that they were motivated by any illfeeling or bad blood to falsely testify against appellants consequently the said testimonies must be accorded the respect and credence due them prosecution witness vivencio arevalo testified thusly q on june 13 1991 at around 900 oclock in the evening will you please tell the honorable court where  sic  you were a we were in the house of gregorio lindog q where is that house of gregorio lindog located a also at barangay cambuja sta maria

name nicanor llanes 28 on his part dominador valenzuela testified as follows q and while watching the betamax in the house of lindog do you remember if there was any unusual incident that transpired a yes sir q what was that unusual incident that transpired according to you a i heard gun shots q how many gunshots did you hear a four  4  q what happened next if any after you heard that four gun

told to you if any by the victim julian de silva aside from what you have stated a we asked him three times the person responsible for shooting him because we could not believe that those persons are responsible for shooting him are the herein accused because they are his relativeperusing the above testimonies appellants contend that there is an inconsistency with respect to the identity of appellant leandro llanes they claim that considering that witnesses arevalo and valenzuela approached the victim at the same time why was it that arevalo declared that the victim was shot by   ago and agos father   while valenzuela testified that the victim said that he was shot by   his cousin alan and uncle nicandro

homicide, ambrocio and anacita benedicto owned a sarisari store in their house in marigold subdivision san jose del monte bulacan according to anacita at around 630 in the evening of february 7 1996 appellant angel rios a neighbor hurled stones at their house a few minutes later and while the benedicto spouses were tending their store appellant bought cigarettes ambrocio confronted appellant about the stoning incident and an altercation ensued between them as the two engaged in a verbal tussle joselino mesa and his fellow barangay tanods named amorsolo dayao rivera and espino who were roving the vicinity chanced upon the disputants having heard the appellant shout at ambrocio mesa intervened and requested the two to part ways he even escorted them to their respective residences a few minutes later appellant went back to the store just then anacita saw her husband go to the terrace of their house appellant suddenly approached ambrocio and stabbed his right stomach anacita was only a meter away from the antagonists; she was facing her husbands back while appellant was standing in front of ambrocio as anacita started shouting appellant fled mesa and his group saw anacita weeping while ambrocio was lying lifeless in the terrace of their house anacita told the tanods that appellant had stabbed her husband one of the tanods assisted ambrocio but the latter succumbed to death even before they could reach the hospital the postmortem certificate of death shows that ambrocio died of   shock due to a stab wound at the chest around 3 cm penetrating the right auricle  heart    mesa and his companions arrested appellant in his brothers house thirty  30  minutes after the crime happened the following day anacita and mesa executed sworn statements before the police with only appellant testifying the defense interposed alibi appellant a 39yearold laborer from san fernando romblon who had been staying for two decades with his brother in graceville marilao bulacan had reported to his job in san jose del monte bulacan at 700 am of february 7 1996 he stopped working at 500 pm and returned to his brothers house reaching it at around 800 pm moments later joselino mesa accompanied by some barangays tanods arrived and brought him to the municipal hall of san jose del monte they did not inform him that he was a suspect in the killing of ambrocio benedicto appellant knew ambrocio because they had built a house near the benedictos residence and it was from the latters store that they would buy their cooking needs he denied having seen amborcio on that fateful day of february 7 1996 no cogent reason exists to overturn the trial courts assessment that anacita benedicto positively and unequivocally identified appellant as the felon who stabbed her husband it is doctrinal that the trial courts evaluation of the credibility of a testimony is accorded the highest respect for the trial court has an untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and thus to determine whether he or she is telling the truth anacitas testimony on the matter clearly supports the trial courts finding on the matter thus fiscal q  where is this ambrocio benedicto your husband now a  hes already dead q  tell us what is the cause of death of your husband a  he was stabbed q  by whom madam witness a  by angel rios fiscal q  madam witness if angel rios is around in this courtroom will you be able to identify him witness a  yes sir fiscal will you please stand up and look around and point him to us  witness pointed to man in yellow shirt who gave the name of angel rios  court q  why do you say that it was angel rios who stabbed your husband a  because i saw him fiscal q  when was your husband stabbed by angel rios a  he was stabbed on february 7 1996 court q  at what time a  more or less 800 in the evening fiscal q  where a  in the terrace of our house q  where is your house located a  in muzon san jose del monte bulacan  emphasis supplied  there is no doubt therefore that anacita had a good look at her husbands assailant and that she actually saw appellant stab ambrocio as she was only a meter away from them behind her husband who was facing appellant she could not have mistaken another man for appellant because being neighbors he was familiar to her aside from being her neighbor appellant even admitted that he used to be a customer in the benedictos sarisari store where he would buy cooking needs familiarity with the physical features particularly those of the face is the best way to identify a person thus in the absence of an established ill motive on the part of anacita her identification of appellant as her husbands killer should be given full faith and credit her relationship with the victim notwithstanding relationship with the victim per se is not proof of prejudice anacitas failure to name the weapon used by appellant and to recall his position as he stabbed ambrocio cannot diminish her credibility her relative position to the two accounts for anacitas failure to see the details surrounding the incident witnesses are not expected to remember every single detail of an incident with perfect or total recall nevertheless anacitas onemeter distance from the two enabled her to observe the manner by which appellant stabbed ambrocio  he did so in a manner described in the dialect as   pakadyot   meaning the bladed instrument came from underneath appellants positive identification of appellant as the perpetrator of the crime was thus proven beyond reasonable doubt by the consistent and firm testimony of anacita benedicto consequently such positive identification effectively effaced appellants alibi that she was the only eyewitness to the killing presented by the prosecution did not in any way dilute the evidentiary value of her credible testimony it is entrenched in jurisprudence that the testimony of a single witness if found convincing and credible by the trial court is sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt however appellant is correct in arguing that treachery did not attend the commission of the crime its presence was not established beyond reasonable doubt as this court said in people v derilo it is an ancient but revered doctrine that qualifying and aggravating circumstance before being taken into consideration for the purpose of increasing the degree of the penalty to be imposed must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as that which establishes the commission of the act charged as a criminal offense it is not only the central fact of a killing that must be shown beyond reasonable doubt; every qualifying and aggravating circumstance alleged to have been present and to have attended such killing must similarly be shown by the same degree of proof in this case the prosecution failed to discharge its duty under the law as regards the qualifying circumstance of treachery there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons employing means methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party may make to constitute treachery these two conditions must be present  1  employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and  2  the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted treachery may not be appreciated where as in this case the attack against the victim cannot be categorized as unexpected and unforeseen so as to deprive him the opportunity to defend himself by the facts of the case where the incident of the victim berating the accused for throwing stones at his residence preceded the fatal assault a possible retaliation by the accused was not remote as this court has repeatedly held there is no treachery when the victim is placed on guard as when a heated argument preceded the attack especially when the victim was standing face to face with his assailant in that instance the initial assault could not have been unforeseen moreover where treachery is alleged the manner of attack must be proven absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded treachery cannot be appreciated it cannot be presumed or concluded merely on the basis of the resulting crime in the case at bar the prosecution presented anacitas ambiguous testimony on how the attack began to support its claim that treachery attended the commission of the crime thus q  before the stabbing was there conversation between them a  my husband went outside our terrace q  then what happened a  then i saw him stabbed q  by whom a  by angel q  what weapon a  i did not see the weapon used court q  how many times a  only once q  what did you do a  i shouted q  how far were you from the stabbing a  more or less one  1  meter fiscal q  madam witness when your husband was stabbed by angel rios what was his position at that time a  my husband was standing at that time q  where was your husband hit by the stab of angel rios a  in his right stomach q  what is the position of the accused when he stabbed your husband a  i did not see q  you did not see who stabbed your husband what i mean to say is was the accused also fronting your husband a  what i only saw your honor was my husband was stabbed    emphasis supplied  on crossexamination anacita testified as follows q  madam witness i will be showing to you transcript of stenographic notes taken down on may 31 1996   court what is the defense atty tolentino he did not do it your honor q     by the question of the court   what was the position of the accused when he stabbed your husband   witness a    i did not see   it was   pakadyot   maam q  you said that the accused stabbed your husband in the manner that you said   pakadyot   will you tell the court when your husband was stabbed by the accused how was he positioned in relation to your husband a  he was facing my husband court q  sitting down or standing up a  they were standing up q  what about you what was the position of the accused in relation to you when you said you saw the incident a  i cannot understand where i was q  what about your position in relation to your husband when the incident was happening a  i only saw it when i went out x x x x x x x x x q  will you tell the honorable court the position of your husband in relation to you was your husbands back towards you or was your husband facing you a  my husbands back was in front of me q  what about the accused how was he positioned in relation to you a  the accused was facing me frontally atty tolentino q  and you said you were just one meter away from them a  i cannot remember because i did not see how he was stabbed from this testimony it is indubitable that anacita saw the stabbing incident but she could not describe exactly how it was commenced notwithstanding what appears to be her conclusion that the stabbing was done in a   pakadyot   manner this may perhaps be blamed on the frailty of human memory but it does not obliterate the fact the she actually saw the stabbing incident the doubt as to its manner or mode of execution should therefore be resolved in favor of the appellant  
homicide, that on or about the 12th day of december 1989 in the municipality of cabatuan province of iloilo philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court with deliberate intent and decided purpose to kill with treachery and evident premeditation armed with a 12 gauge homemade shotgun commonly known as   pugakhang   and without any justifiable cause or motive did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously assault attack and shoot one allan dominguez with the firearm accused was then provided inflicting upon said victim fatal gunshot wound on the head which caused the immediate death of said allan dominguez contrary to law  p 8 rollo  the prosecutions version of the generative facts as gathered from the testimony of its witnesses  guillermo dominguez father of the victim and annalyn dominguez sister of the victim  is abstracted in the appellees brief as follows at around 900 oclock in the evening of december 12 1989 prosecution witnesses guillermo dominguez and his daughter annalyn dominguez together with his son allan dominguez were in the house of the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita situated at janipaan central cabatuan iloilo appellant salvador caguing and his companion bebot malcaredo were also inside said house appellant was engaged in conversation with the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita in the course thereof appellant asked for the identity of allan dominguez after finding out the identity of allan appellant suddenly shot the former on the head with a shotgun resulting in his instantaneous death allan was seated on a chair beside a table while appellant was standing when the former was fatally shot afterwards appellant reloaded his shotgun and warned the people inside the house not to move thereafter appellant and his companion bebot malcaredo fled  pp 8485 rollo  dr mae albacite the rural health physician who conducted the autopsy on the victims body testified that the cause of death of the victim was severe hemorrhage from a skull fracture due to a gunshot wound in the head; that the wound was located at the forehead front with frontal and parietal bones missing which are parts of the skull; that the frontal lobe of the brain was already scattered on the face and skull of the victim; that there was the presence of an incised and gaping wound two inches by five inches located above the right ear up to the backbone located at the right side of the back; that the wound located at the frontal area with missing frontal and parietal bones was caused by a gunshot; that with regard to the incised wound it had rugged edges which could have been caused by a blunt object and there was the probability that it was caused by forcible tearing of the tissue due to impact of the gunshot; that even with adequate medical attention the probability of the victim living was nil because a vital organ was involved; and that there is a probability that the assailant was in front of the victim the version of the defense is based on the testimony of noe malcaredo y bebot friend of accusedappellant and accusedappellant himself accusedappellant denied the charge the defense that accusedappellant and the victim had an altercation and that he shot the victim in selfdefense was also advanced he particularly argues that treachery is negated by the fact that if accusedappellant were indeed armed when he arrived at 8 oclock in the evening an hour prior to the shooting incident that would have already put the victim on guard; that both prosecution witnesses never testified that accusedappellant was armed when he entered the place of the incident and their testimony are full of inconsistencies; that it was the victims persistence in attacking accusedappellant with a knife which led accusedappellant to shoot the victim in selfdefense; and lastly the declarations of the prosecution witnesses do not indicate any possible motive for accusedappellant to shoot the victim undisputed is the fact that accusedappellant shot one allan dominguez categorically he admitted that he shot the victim once in the forehead but asserts that he did so in selfdefense in selfdefense the burden of proof rests upon the accused  people vs timblor 385 scra 64  it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself otherwise conviction would follow from his admission that he killed the victim  people vs cario 288 scra 404  there are three requisites to prove the claim of selfdefense  1  unlawful aggression on the part of the victim;  2  reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused to prevent or repel it; and  3  lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself unlawful aggression presupposes an actual sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof  people vs aguilar 292 scra 349  the person defending himself must have been attacked with actual physical force or with actual use of weapon unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non for the justifying circumstance of selfdefense there can be no selfdefense complete or incomplete unless the victim has committed unlawful aggression against the person defending himself  people vs cario supra  in this case the testimony of accusedappellant himself belies the claim that he merely acted to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression allegedly coming from the victim accusedappellants unequivocal statements in open court lead to the conclusion that assuming arguendo that the victim indeed attempted to shoot accusedappellant with a handgun this aggression had ceased by the time accusedappellant was able to take possession of the gun in other words when accusedappellant successfully grabbed the gun from the victim there was no longer any unlawful aggression to prevent or repel and this court has consistently held that when the unlawful aggression which has begun no longer exists the one making the defense has no more right to kill or even wound the former aggressor  people vs albao 287 scra 129 ;people vs sambulan 239 scra 500  withal a finding that there was no longer any unlawful aggression when the accused shot the victim rules out the possibility of selfdefense whether complete or incomplete  david vs court of appeals 290 scra 727  just to be on the safe side accusedappellant embellishes his story by alleging that the victim after having been disarmed of the gun continued his aggression with a knife here now comes the second element of self defense for such posture to be properly appreciated there should be a necessity in both the action taken as well as in the means used and the latter depends on whether the aggressor himself was armed the nature and quality of the weapon used and the physical conditions and sizes of both the aggressor and the person defending himself  escoto vs ca 273 scra 752  undoubtedly if it is true that the victim had a knife and accusedappellant had a gun his shooting the victim may not be justified as accusedappellant could not have been in any real danger of his life the knife was no match to the homemade handgun of accusedappellant and in fact there is no evidence that accusedappellant sustained any injuries evincive of an aggression which would justify his firing the gun to protect himself thus the shooting was unwarranted and was an unreasonable act of violence even as a means of defense under the circumstances moreover accusedappellant left his victim and did not even bother to report the matter to the proper authorities in this light the justifying circumstance of selfdefense may not survive in the face of accusedappellants flight from the crime scene and his failure to inform the authorities of the incident  people vs gerolaga 263 scra 143  too no knife was found in the crime scene thus negating his tale of a second aggression all told the plea of selfdefense cannot be justifiably entertained where it is not only uncorroborated by any separate competent evidence but is also extremely doubtful in itself  jacobo vs ca 270 scra 270  accusedappellant having failed to discharge the burden proving his defense his conviction shall of necessity follow on the basis of his admission to the killing accusedappellant argues that there was misappreciation of evidence since the judge who decided the case was not the one who heard the evidence for the prosecution we cannot ascribe merit to the argument since it is wellrecognized that the trial judges assessment of the credibility of a testimony is not to be anchored solely on how the witness conducted himself on the witness stand aside from the danger of being misled by appearance inherent in such a case a judge is supposed to render a decision on the basis of the evidence before him meaning the record and all the failure to be sure of the trial judge to have personally observed the prosecution witnesses manner and demeanor of testifying in no way affects the validity of the judgment rendered nor does ipso facto condemn the judgment erroneous more so where the same appears to be fully supported by the evidence on record as in the case at bar  people vs rayray 241 scra 1  nonetheless while the court affirms the guilt of accusedappellant it is not persuaded that there was treachery which would qualify the killing of allan to murder treachery exists when the offender employs means methods or forms in the execution of the offense which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make  people vs sumalpong 284 scra 464  in order for treachery to be taken as an aggravating circumstance there must be proof that accusedappellant had consciously adopted a mode of attack to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself  people vs quitlong 292 scra 360  it should preliminarily be observed that both the prosecution and the defense witnesses are consistent in their assertions that accusedappellant and his companion bebot arrived in the crime scene at around 8 oclock in the evening; and that accusedappellant and his friend stayed on and conversed with the spouses gonzalo and duliana cornita in the kitchen where allan and his father guillermo and one romulo percy were at that time it appears then that before accusedappellant shot the victim he had been there for about an hour during which time there had been an on going drinking spree for this reason the court finds it difficult to believe that allan guillermo spouses gonzalo and cornita one romulo percy and accusedappellant and companion were all in one and the same kitchen seated around in one and the same table and not talking to one another for about an hour the court perceives as odd and unnatural that while allan was seated alongside bebot and accusedappellant from 8 oclock to 9 oclock in the evening they did not engage in any sort of conversation or discussion even the testimony of guillermo that allan did not know accusedappellant and vice versa so that accusedappellant had to wait an hour to ask for the victims identity in order to kill him is doubtful it is of judicial notice that people in rural communities generally know each other both by face and name  people vs reynaldo 291 scra 701  even the then 11yearold analyn claimed she knew accusedappellant  tsn dec 10 1997 p 4  making it doubly hard for the court to believe that accusedappellant and the victim did not know each other another point to consider is the testimony of analyn which narrated the incident in this wise q now when you heard the gunshot you were playing a we were already through playing we were already talking with each other in the sala q you talked with each other together with the children of dullana a yes sir  ibid p 12  x x x x x x x x x q meaning when salvador caguing and companion arrived they seated around the table together with your brother a yes sir q also your father a my father was in the improvised bed   papag   taking a rest q so while your brother was seated there in the table caguing bebot and duliana your father was resting in the papag a yes sir q because it was almost one hour after the arrival of these salvador caguing and companion when you heard the gunshot a that was already nine oclock when i heard the gunshot and salvador caguing shot my brother  ibid p 22  x x x x x x x x x q at eight oclock you were playing you were conversing a yes sir q and you did not mind the accused and bebot because you were conversing a yes sir they were conversing with other people inside the house  ibid p 21  so far as one can see it cannot be said that analyn witnessed how his brother allan was killed by accusedappellant admittedly she was unmindful of what was going on in the kitchen because she herself was conversing with her friends in the sala what caught her attention was the gunshot that she heard coming from the kitchen and she inferred that accusedappellant shot his brother allan further the testimony of guillermo and analyn are contradictory in relation to the physical position of guillermo at the time of the killing guillermo testified that he was likewise seated around the table on the other hand analyn said guillermo was taking a rest in the   papag   the general rule is that inconsistencies and contradictions in minor and trivial matter do not impair a witness credibility however the contradictory statements and omission of important details by the prosecution witnesses erode the credence of their testimony  people vs ortiz 266 scra 641  the physical position of guillermo when the victim was killed by accusedappellant is one vital circumstance that would establish whether or not he had really seen how the accusedappellant shot the victim which will consequently prove the attendance of treachery in the killing of the victim the prosecution failed in this endeavor it must be stressed that treachery cannot be presumed it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself  people vs pe 291 scra 606  in treachery the mode of attack must have been sought of by the offender  people vs demonteverde 290 scra 175  and the manner of attack must be proven; it cannot be presumed or concluded merely on the basis of the resulting crime  people vs asis 286 scra 64    
murder, the antecedent proceedings that on or about the 10th day of november 1990 at nadres street labak municipality of candelaria province of quezon philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the accused eddie isleta armed with a bladed weapon with intent to kill with treachery and evident premeditation conspiring and confederating together with the accused celso bulahan leon magbuhos and gregorio de gala and mutually helping one another did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and stab with the said weapon one moises balbarosa thereby inflicting upon the latter a stab wound on his abdomen which directly caused his death that the accused eddie isleta attacked and stabbed with the said weapon said moises balbarosa suddenly and unexpectedly without giving the latter any opportunity to defend himself or to escape that the accused celso bulahan leon magbuhos and gregorio de gala participated in the commission of the crime as principal  sic  by inducing the accused eddie isleta to kill said moises balbarosa and by participating in planning said a offense contrary to law the facts according to the prosecution on november 10 1990 at around 5 oclock in the afternoon prosecution witness moises roberto balbarosa son of the victim moises balbarosa was resting near the gate  tarangkahan  of the balbarosa residence at nadres street candelaria quezon from where he sat he noticed that bulahan de gala magbuhos and the appellant were having a drinking spree inside the house of bulahan which was also situated along nadres st while resting he saw appellant isleta come out twice from the house of bulahan accompanied first by bulahan and later by magbuhos on these two occasions both magbuhos and bulahan pointed to deceased balbarosas house afterwards appellant went out of bulahans house and seated himself on a bench at a store located in front of balbarosas house about twenty  20  meters from bulahans place when the victim moises balbarosa arrived a little later appellant stood up and without any warning immediately stabbed the former who thereupon fell to the ground moises balbarosa was brought to the candelaria municipal hospital but was later taken in an ambulance for transfer to a hospital in lucena city however he expired along the way corroborating witness gina dimaunahan testified that at around 5 oclock that afternoon she happened to look out the front window of her grandmothers house at nadres street and noticed appellant sitting on a bench at a store when her father moises balbarosa arrived the appellant immediately stood up and suddenly without provocation stabbed the former the hapless balbarosa tried to parry the thrust by attempting to hold a bamboo pole used as a clothesline support    tukod    but was unsuccessful because he could not budge said pole appellant stabbed balbarosa in the stomach and thereafter fled the scene of the crime  nine months appellant was apprehended by policeman jaime bagsik of the laguna station  in addition to gina balbarosa dimaunahan and moises roberto balbarosa the prosecution presented maria theresa balbarosagalang who testified that appellant acted upon the inducement of the other accused she claimed that the four accused plotted to kill a person whose identity she did not know at the time she said she went to bulahans house earlier in the afternoon of that fateful day to collect the contribution of felisa bulahan wife of accused bulahan to their   turnohan    a financial accommodation scheme practised locally also known as   paluwagan    she did not enter said house because the appellant and the other accused were having a drinking spree inside but as she stood near the window outside bulahans house she overheard their conversation she allegedly heard magbuhos say   gori may problema si celso   de gala  gori  answered   huwag kang magalala akong bahala killer ang kasama ko   appellant then boasted   basta ituro nyo isang tusok lang yan   bulahan replied   ituturo ko sa iyo pero wala akong sabit   anxious about what she heard galang changed her mind and desisted from collecting from felisa bulahan she also did not realize the full import of the conversation she had overheard when she left for the next house she heard some shouting but it was only later on that she learned from a certain jovy salazar that her father had been stabbed she recalled that prior to this incident her father and bulahan had altercation over the formers sideswiping of the latters vehicle the matter was even brought to the attention of their barangay captain sometime in october 1990 she also presented her fathers death certificate  exhibit   a   which attributes the victims death to hemorrhage due to stab wound she further testified that her family incurred burial expenses amounting to p3000000 according to the defense the defense relied solely on appellants uncorroborated testimony appellant admitted stabbing the victim but denied that it was at the instance of bulahan claiming he acted alone he explained that he was de galas brotherinlaw and that he went to candelaria that day upon the latters invitation regarding a job upon arriving in candelaria around 230 pm he and de gala were invited by bulahan to his house for a drinking spree during the drinking session he went to a nearby store to buy cigarettes and noticed someone whom he later learned was moises balbarosa staring    masama and tingin    at him after buying cigarettes he returned to the house when he went out of the house again balbarosa approached him and suddenly tried to stab him with a pointed bamboo pole he was hit in his left arm pit as the victim thrust the pole at him again he caught it and struggled for possession of the bamboo in the scuffle he accidentally stabbed the victim in the abdomen appellant fled to dalahican lucena city he allegedly went with his wife to a certain barangay captain magadia of dalahican to report the incident but said barangay captain died before he could be presented in court this qualifying circumstance was established by prosecution witnesses gina dimaunahan and moises roberto balbarosa the gist of their testimony is that after waiting for about seven to ten minutes for the victim to arrive appellant upon seeing the victim immediately stood up and suddenly and unexpectedly stabbed the victim sans provocation or warning testified dimaunahanq on nov 10 1990 in the afternoon do you remember where were you a at home with my grandmother sir xxx xxx xxx q and during that time in that

homicide, that on or about the 14th day of june 1991 at barangay sta cruz municipality of casiguran province of sorsogon philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused conspiring confederating and mutually helping one another each armed with m14 rifle with treachery and evident premeditation did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and shoot one antonio rosas thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal wound which directly caused the death of said antonio rosas to the damage and prejudice of his legal heirs contrary to lawthe evidence for the prosecution is summarized by the trial court in this manner the witness to the incident reynaldo halcon testified among others that at about 330 and 400 oclock in the afternoon of june 14 1991 at sta cruz casiguran sorsogon while he and antonio rosas were walking along the lower portion of the feeder road on his way home and antonio rosas on his way to work in the field he heard somebody tell antonio to lower down his hoe while he was at a distance of about 4 meters from antonio rosas; that he hid behind the chinese bamboo and saw the two accused demetrio hubilla and salvador palle who were cafgu members poking their m14 rifle to antonio rosas; that when antonio rosas did not lower down his hoe as commanded he was shot near his feet by demetrio hubilla jr; that when antonio rosas ran he was again shot by demetrio hubilla jr and this time he was hit and fell down; that salvador palle was also poking his rifle to the victim but did not fire a shot; that when he approached the victim the latter was already dead; that he notified the wife that her husband was already dead the widow of the victim consuelo rosas testified that she was at their house at sta cruz casiguran sorsogon on june 14 1991 at about 330 to 400 oclock in the afternoon when she was informed by reynaldo halcon that her husband is already dead; that she immediately went to the place of the incident which is about 50 meters distance and that she found her husband covered with blood and already dead; that he died of a single gunshot wound; that she asked for help and some people went to casiguran to ask for the help of the police authorities; that they brought the remains of her husband to the sorsogon provincial hospital for autopsy; that dr wilhelmo abrantes conducted the autopsy and a copy of the autopsy report  exh   a    and certificate of death  exh   b    were issued; that her husband stayed in wake for four  4  days in their house and that she spent more than p1000000; that she felt very sad considering that she had two minor children the eldest is 3 years old and the other one is onehalf  1/2  month old on crossexamination she declared that reynaldo halcon accompanied her to the place of the incident; that the two accused are residents of the same place but are staying at the detachment because they are cafgu members; that they are friends of her husband and she does not know why he was shot dr wilhelmo abrantes testified that he conducted the autopsy on the body of antonio rosas and prepared the autopsy report  exh   a    showing that the cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due to gunshot wounds; that he likewise signed the certificate of death  exh   b   the defense had a different version appellant demetrio hubilla testified that while he and appellant salvador palle a fellow cafgu member were walking from their detachment on 14 june 1991 at around 200 pm the victim antonio rosas suddenly appeared and attacked them with a hoe antonio succeeded in hitting salvadors hands with the hoe causing the latter to drop his m14 rifle to the ground antonio got the rifle and squeezed its trigger however the rifle failed to discharge salvador ran away while demetrio shouted at antonio to drop the rifle and then fired a warning shot into the air instead antonio loaded and cocked the rifle and aimed it at demetrio fearing for his life demetrio shot antonio and subsequently surrendered himself together with salvador at camp escuderoappellant salvador palle testified that at around 400 pm on the same date he was walking home with demetrio hubilla when antonio rosas suddenly struck his rifle with a hoe causing it to fall down he forthwith fled towards his detachment leaving behind antonio and demetrio as he was running towards his detachment he heard two shots he did not know anymore what happened between demetrio and antonio he proceeded to inform assistant commander realoye that his rifle was wrested from him it was only much later on that he found out that antonio sustained injuriesthe trial court did not give credence to the appellants claim of selfdefense it stated thus the version of the accused to the effect that they acted in selfdefense is unworthy of belief here are two cafgu members fully armed with m14 rifles allegedly defending themselves against the attack of a person with only a hoe as his weapon unless out of his mind or bent on committing suicide no one in the ordinary course of events will dare challenge or attack two people fully armed with m14 rifles with only a hoe as his weapon and expect to come out alive and in good health it was admitted by the accused demetrio hubilla jr that he shot the victim causing his instantaneous death while his companion salvador palle and as testified to by reynaldo halcon poked his rifle to the victim without however firing a single shot these individual but simultaneous acts of the two accused had immobilized the victim and ensured his death demetrio hubilla jr and salvador palle are conspirators a coconspirator need not fire a shot if he was present and gave moral support to the assailant  58 scra p 450  records show that reynaldo halcon the only eyewitness for the prosecution answered questions in a straightforward manner relaying with clarity how the incident actually happened the plea of selfdefense by the accused is not sufficient to overthrow the clear testimony of the prosecutions witnesses accused salvador palle testified that the victim attacked him with a hoe this hit his rifle causing it to fall to the ground palle then ran away he testified though that he did not see the victim pick up the rifle and point it at him from this testimony palle invoked selfdefense this is flimsy and absurd being a cafgu member he is supposed to be wellversed in handling firearms as compared to the victim besides both the accused were armed with m14 rifles while the victim carried only a hoe obviously there was no reasonable necessity of the use of the firearms to repel the aggression by the victim hence the theory of selfdefense is incredible the burden of proof in selfdefense is upon the accused  133 scra p 82 the appellants insist that it is not true that the victim was shot while he was running away; he was facing them as shown by the fatal bullet which entered the frontal neck of antonio such a conclusion is drawn from the following answers of the eyewitness fiscal borromeo q after demetrio hubilla jr fired his m14 rifle near the feet of antonio rosas what happened next a when antonio rosas was able to run he was again shot by demetrio hubilla jr q tell us if antonio rosas was hit by the second shot a yes sir he was hit q in what part of the body was he hit a  witness pointing to the left jaw   emphasis supplied  the point of entry of the bullet belies the theory of the appellants for if indeed the victim was facing them he would not have been hit on the left side of the neck as found by the doctor or the   left jaw   as described by the eyewitness appellant palle was with hubilla when they encountered the victim although he did not fire the fatal shot he too jabbed his rifle at the victim thereby helping hubilla intimidate the victim after hubilla hit the victim with the second shot palle fled with hubilla towards their detachment from the time they confronted the victim up to when they retreated from the scene of the shooting palle acted in unison with hubilla he cannot claim to have been a passive observer while he did not fire a single shot his conduct indicated complete cooperation with hubilla his armed presence unquestionably gave encouragement and a sense of security to hubilla hence his liability is that of a coconspirator for where conspiracy is established the act of one is the act of all for treachery to be appreciated two conditions must be present to wit  1  the means of execution employed gives the person no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and  2  the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted in the instant case the victim upon encountering the appellants was told to lower down his hoe he refused to do so the appellants thereupon poked him with their rifles and repeated the command but still he refused to follow the appellants order this prompted hubilla to shoot him near his feet whereupon the victim ran but he was not able to get away as hubilla shot him hitting him in the neck from the incident narrated by eyewitness reynaldo halcon we do not find any evidence that the appellants deliberately employed means of execution that would give the victim no opportunity to retaliate or defend himself the victim was already forewarned or put on guard by the actuations of the appellants in hitting him with their rifles and in shooting near his feet evident premeditation was not proven by the prosecution either there is no proof of  1  the time when the appellants determined to commit the crime;  2  an act manifestly indicating that they have clung to their determination; and  3  sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow them an opportunity to reflect upon the consequences of their act the encounter between the appellants and the victim was casual and the attack made by the appellants was at the spur of the moment

accusedappellant cual was pursued or whether he surrendered he stated that he was only told that the accused was apprehended he was not told whether the said accused voluntarily surrendered or whether the latter was pursued by the apprehending officersthe defense for its part introduced the testimonies of the two accusedappellants to support their contention that they were innocent of the crime charged against them accusedappellant dario villoceno first narrated the events which led to the killing incident he testified that two days before the incident or on february 24 1994 at around 400 in the afternoon the victim ramil sabturani approached him and challenged him to fight while he was eating his snack near the house which he was working on in balulang cagayan de oro cityhe admitted that he and the victim often worked together as subcontractors he surmised that the reason the victim was angry with him was because the project engineer had given him a task that was originally assigned to the victim but which had been delayedhe did not accept the challenge and instead he simply stepped back which prompted the victim to throw stones at him he was able to evade the attack and afterwards he ran towards the house he was working on while he saw the victim run towards the house of a certain julie sison he surmised that the victim was looking for a weapon at this time as he heard somebody shout   do not do that   when the victim emerged from the house he again threw stones at accusedappellant and his companion the other accused dario cualthey then retaliated by also throwing stones at the victim but they were not able to hit him afterwards the victim went home but he returned soon thereafter brandishing two knives the victim commenced hurling stones at them but again they were not hit they then ran away from the victim but not before seeing the victim being disarmed by the guard of the nha subdivisionthey then went back to the house where they were staying in on that same day at around 900 in the evening ramil sabturani his wife and a certain rey ligan threw stones at their house and shouted at them to go down instead of confronting the victim accusedappellants decided to hide inside their house eventually the group of the victim stopped their stonethrowing as the accusedappellants did not retaliate or answer back at them they were not able to report the incident to the police the following day as the victim and rey ligan were waiting for them they were only able to report the incident and to have the same blottered at around 1000 am of

companion accusedappellant dario cual approached and helped him by hacking ramil sabturani with a bolo he explained that dario cual brought a bolo with him as they were going to use it in rendering

followed him to his house a while later but afterwards cual told his wife that he was going to surrender cual then immediately left the house a policeman later arrived at his house and brought him to the police station where he and cual were both investigated initially only cual was brought to the maharlika center as the arresting officer stated that he had nothing to do with the incident however upon the prodding of a certain engineer eleno dingue the cousin of the victim he was likewise detainedon crossexamination accusedappellant villoceno explained that the bolo cual was carrying was to be used for forming the wood for mixing the cement at that time only cual was carrying a bolo as the work they were doing did not require a good finishhe likewise testified that it was the victim who carried a lead pipe while his companion did not carry anything consequently it was the victim who beat him up with the lead pipe he did not know what the latters companion was doing while this was happening he likewise stated that the accused cual helped him by hacking ramil sabturani with the bolo he was carrying he further stated that once the attention of ramil sabturani was on dario cual he stood up slowly and left while the two were still fightingbefore leaving the scene he stated that he saw the victim ride a trisikad and attempt to bump dario cual the other accused dario cual corroborated the testimony of dario villoceno as to the events that led to the killing incident including the challenge made by the victim to his coaccused and the stonethrowing incidents as to the reason for these confrontations he stated that villoceno and the victim had a previous quarrel regarding a certain plumbing job which was given to villoceno by the project engineerdario cual had a

victim kept on trying to stab him while he kept on moving backward when his back was against the wall he hacked the victim on the head with the bolo he was carryingafterwards the victim ran towards a parked trisikad and rode on it the victim then attempted to run over him but he was only hit by the steering wheel of the vehicle thereafter he hacked the victim again although he could not remember

went to himafter the incident he walked towards his house where he met his wife who was already crying because of the incident when they reached their house he talked with his wife and told her he was going to surrenderhe was not able to reach the police station as he met the policemen on the way to the precinct at balongis when the policemen got off their vehicle he gave them his bolo and he told them that he was going to surrenderto arrive at a conviction the prosecution principally relied on the testimony of the alleged eyewitness leodico caayao who testified as follows q and while you were watching tv can you recall if there was any unusual incident that happened that evening a there was q and tell the court what was that unusual incident a there were two persons grappling for the possession of the steel pipe q and how far were these two persons from you whom you said was grappling for the possession of the steel pipe a about two arms length q and did you recognize these two persons whom you said was grappling for the possession of the steel pipe a yes sir q who were these two persons a ramil and dario villoceno x x x q when you saw ramil sabturani and dario villoceno grappling for the possession of the steel pipe what happened next a another person arrived q and who was this person that arrived a dario cual x x x q what happened when dario cual arrived at the scene a he hacked ramil q what weapon did you see was used by dario cual in hacking ramil a a bolo q did you see what part of the body of ramil sabturani was hacked by dario cual a i did not see anymore q what happened after ramil sabturani was hacked by dario cual with a bolo a ramil was able to run to my trisikad q and when ramil reached your trisikad what did he do a he attempted to drive my trisikad q was he able to drive away your trisikad a he was able to only make a turn q why was he able to make only a turn of your trisikad a because he was then chased upon and caught q caught by whom a dario cual q what happened when dario cual caught ramil a he then hacked successively ramil sabturani q using the same bolo a yes the same bolo q where was ramil hacked by dario cual inside your trisikad a inside x x x q did you hear anything coming from dario cual or from ramil sabturani while he was being hacked by dario cual a yes sir q what did you hear and from whom did you hear a i heard ramil asking for pity or mercy q what exactly were the words uttered by ramil sabturani pleading for mercy from dario cual a and he said that is enough because that was only a little trouble and you pity me q did you hear if dario cual also replied for a plea of mercy from ramil sabturani a nonefrom the above narration it is clear that evident premeditation cannot be appreciated for evident premeditation to aggravate a crime there must be proof as clear as the evidence of the crime itself of the following elements  1  the time when the offender determined to commit the crime;  2  an act manifestly indicating that he clung to his determination; and  3  sufficient lapse of time between determination and execution to allow himself to reflect upon the consequences of his actas shown above however the prosecution failed to prove any element of this qualifying circumstance as their only eyewitness merely testified on the actual commission of the crime where there is no showing as to how and when the plan to kill was hatched or what time had elapsed before it was carried out evident premeditation cannot be considered to existto summarize the presence of treachery in the case at bench has not been proven as fully and convincingly as the crime itself the doubt must therefore be resolved in favor of the appellantwith respect to the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength we likewise find that it is not attendant under the circumstances in order to appreciate this qualifying circumstance there must be evidence introduced that the two accusedappellants were physically stronger that the victim and that they abused such superiority by taking advantage of their combined strength in order to consummate the offensein the case at bench the prosecution failed to introduce any evidence as to the relative physical strength of the parties involved in fact the lone eyewitness to the incident leodivico caayao was noncommittal on this aspect   atty merlas  to the witness  q and this sabtorani you can recall is builded is it not a tall and slim i could not tell correctly as to his height q when you say taller between this accused villoceno and the deceased sabturani who is taller a sabturani was taller q and in fact he was also bigger than the accused a i did not see clearly because he was seated  moreover the testimony of the eyewitness shows that at no point did the two accusedappellants attack the victim simultaneously as it was only accused cual who deliberately attacked the latter and even assuming that accusedappellant cual was stronger than the victim abuse of superior strength still cannot be appreciated as there is no showing that accusedappellant deliberately intended to take advantage of such superiority

  2  juanito flores the sole eyewitness to the killing; and  3  lourdes noel the victims widow the defense presented eight  8  witnesses in all whose testimonies support either directly or indirectly the version of the defense that it was only accused michael who stabbed the victim accused gregorio testified that at the time of the stabbing incident he was having a drinking session with his friend william entoma at the latters house which is located some 50 meters from the locus criminiswilliam entoma corroborated this storyappellant rodel testified and interposed the defense of denial and alibi he claimed that he was with his girlfriend elizabeth redoblado from 645 until 1200 in the evening on the night of the stabbing incident first they heard mass at the sto ni church then went to the eden theater to buy balut which they brought to a friend at camp sergio osme afterwards they had snacks at snowsheen restaurant then at around 1000 pm they visited their friends nestor and myrna aldemer and had some drinks with them at around 1200 pm appellant and his girlfriend went homeelizabeth redoblado confirmed appellants story in courtdefense witnesses nestor ardemer a 34 yearold golf caddie also testified that appellant and his girlfriend dropped by his house on the night of april 24 1983 upon clarificatory question by the court however he was not quite sure whether it was on that specific night or the two nights previouslydefense witness jovita romero further testified that prosecution witness flores allegedly told her that his motive in testifying against the accused was because he was already implicated in the casethe other defense witnesses namely jessie robisano an 18 yearold second year high school student and bagger at the gaisano superstore warehouse and delia labador a 21 yearold high school graduate testified that on the night of the incident they were at the sikatuna young men and women association  symwa  club located at the interior of sikatuna st talking with accused michael the victim approached the group and asked about the whereabouts of nestor the brother of labador when michael asked the victim why he was looking for nestor the victim angrily replied   why are you intervening bay   a heated argument ensued after which michael stooped as if to get something then suddenly stabbed the victim in the stomach and at the back as a result robisano and labador scampered away the two witnesses further testified that they never saw the other three  3  accused within the vicinity during the stabbing incidentin this case the sole eyewitness categorically identified the four accused as the assailants said witness knew accused gregorio and michael since they were his neighbors while he knew appellant rodel since he used to play basketball with himat the same time said witness also knew the victim who was his neighbor the locus criminis was welllighted by a nearby lamppost and the moonlightin fact the witness flores could even recall what the accused and the victim were wearing at that timewhere the prosecution eyewitness was familiar with both victim and accused and where the locus criminis afforded good visibility and where no improper motive can be attributed to him for testifying against the accused then his version of the story deserves much weight though no less than eight  8  witnesses were arrayed against him it is wellsettled that witnesses are to be weighed not numbered such that the testimony of a single trustworthy and credible witness could be sufficient to convict an accusedappellant makes much of the testimony of dr trocio that there is no evidence of contusions from the fistic blows made by appellant and fernando first dr trocios testimony should be put in proper context what he actually said was that he did not see other injuries on the body of the victim this can be explained by the fact that fistic blows do not always result in contusion contusion is the effusion of blood into the tissue underneath the skin on account of the rupture of the blood vessels as a result of the application of blunt force or violenceit may develop after a lapse of minutes or even hours after the application of force the variation depends on the part of the body injured tenderness of the tissues affected condition of the blood vessels involved and natural disease

murder, that on or about the 29th day of june 1963 in the evening in the home economics building within the school premises at bo enriqueta lavezares samar philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court the abovenamed accused armed with deadly weapons conspiring confederating together and mutually helping one another with intent to kill evident premeditation and treachery and taking advantage of their superiority in strength and number and without any justifiable cause did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously attack assault and stab one felipe avendano with said weapons which the herein accused had provided themselves for the purpose thereby inflicting upon said felipe avendano two mortal stab wounds one at the back of the head and the other at the back on the left scapula which mortal wounds caused the instantaneous death of the latter the version of the prosecution was unfolded by prosecution witnesses carlos avendano lydia avendano antonio martires and dr arturo dubongco carlos avenda son of the deceased testified that in the evening of june 29 1963 he was at a window of the home economics building located in barrio enriqueta lavezares samar watching a benefit dance going on inside the said building his sister lydia avendano was also outside near another window felipe avendano their father after dancing for sometime went near a window located close to the door of the building and fanned himself about a fathom away to the rear of his father and two arms length away from carlos were three persons standing at a japanese bamboo grove namely manuel guinto pedro alcantara and enrique cagsawa all of a sudden his father was attacked from behind by these men manuel guinto first slashed his father at the back of the head with a bolo locally known as   kinogon   almost simultaneously his father was stabbed in the back by alcantara with a bolo known locally as   menasbad   carlos knows alcantara well because the latter was a resident of barrio enriqueta lavezares samar enrique cagsawa was posed to strike his father but lydia avendano shouted   enough    and the three  alcantara guinto and cagsawa  fled then carlos rushed to his father who forthwith told him that he was slashed by pedro alcantara and manuel guinto and bade him fetch his mother when later he and his mother arrived they found the victim already dead lydia avendas testimony corroborated that of her brother antonio martires sanitary inspector of lavezares samar testified that on june 30 1963 while he was in the poblacion of lavezares samar he was summoned to examine the wounds sustained by felipe avendano he certified to the following injuries a stab wound at the back of the head at least 5 inches in length b stab wound at the back on the left scapula at least 3 inches in length dr arturo dubongco resident physician of the northern samar general hospital testified that the first wound made by a bladed instrument caused death by reason of hemorrhage but that the second wound not cause death unless complications set in the version of the defense was adduced through the declarations of pedro alcantara ignacio gabion dr leovigildo mijares jr and primo cupido testifying in his own behalf alcantara declared that on june 26 and 27 1963 he was at sitio bayang barrio enriqueta samar gathering coconuts he and a companion ignacio gabion were then making copra he climbed 20 coconuts on the first day and 30 coconuts on the second at around 300 pm of the second day he fell face downward from a coconut tree because he slipped from a notch around four meters high he was able to reach his house only with the help of ignacio gabion who carried him up to his house located in sitio baysay barrio enriqueta lavezares samar the next day june 28 he was loaded by his elder sister bonifacia alcantara in a bus belonging to vicente balasolla and taken to catarman samar where he stayed in the house of another sister lucila who told him to return while she called for dr leovigildo mijares to treat him they left sitio baysay at around 800 am and reached catarman at about 1100 am at around 600 pm of june 28 dr leovigildo mijares jr arrived and examined his body and thereafter gave him three tablets to be taken in the morning noon and evening dr mijares returned to his sisters house in the evening  about 600  of the next day june 29 and inquired about the pains in his chest and in his right and left hips informed that the pains were still bothering him dr mijares again gave him three tablets and told him that if the pains would not subside he  the doctor  would bring him to the hospital the doctor did not tarry long in his sisters house alcantara was in the house of his sister lucila during the whole day of june 29 on june 30 he was brought by his sister to the hospital where he stayed for four days after which he returned to his sisters house after three more days in catarman he went home to lavezares where upon arrival he was arrested by a policeman and brought to the chief of police of lavezares for investigation regarding the death of felipe avendano he disclaimed any knowledge of the killing and expressed surprise why he was accused thereof he knows the other accused manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa and also lydia and carlos avendano the children of the deceased but he does not know why the latter two implicated him before the death of felipe avendano there had arisen no trouble nor did any illfeeling exist between him and the former ignacio gabions testimony corroborated that of alcantara with respect to their making of copra and his fall from a coconut tree dr leovigildo mijares jr testified on the medical treatment of the accused and the latters confinement at the northern samar general hospital in connection with which he issued medical certificates exhibits 2 and 3 primo cupido stated that in the evening of june 29 he was in barrio enriqueta lavezares samar watching the benefit dance at the home economics building at that time he was the barrio lieutenant sometime during the dance because people suddenly scampered away from the place he looked around and found felipe avendano wounded and lying face down by the door of the schoolhouse when he asked avendano what happened to him the latter could not make reply then as cupido withdraw to the center of the hall felipe avendano stood up to lean on the wall of the schoolhouse but fell down after 2 or 3 seconds he tried to question the deceased once more but when the latter failed to answer he informed the relatives about the incident when he first saw the fallen felipe avenda he did not see carlos or lydia avenda beside the deceased he saw them beside their father only when he was already dead the people around denied any knowledge of the incident when he asked lydia if she saw who attacked her father the latter said she was not sure he was unable to investigate carlos avendano because he was continuously crying at the side of his father he notified the chief of police of lavezares samar about the incident on crossexamination he declared that felipe avenda was once accused of killing one donato ligua a cousin of the witness but that the deceased escape prosecution because the case was amicably settled 1 the appellant puts squarely in issue the credibility of carlos avenda and lydia avenda the two eyewitnesses for the prosecution averring that their declarations aside from being biased because they are children of the deceased are not entitled to credit by reason of material inconsistencies his controversion of carlos avendas testimony that his father the deceased told him that he was slashed by manuel guinto and pedro alcantara and bade him fetch his mother is based on the testimony of dr dubongco that because of the nature of the wound sustained by the deceased at the back of his head which is 5 inches long it is possible that the speech center of the brain was impaired causing the deceased to lose his power of speech significantly although dubongco testified on the length of the wound he was silent on the matter of the depth thereof he based his theory of the possibility of brain injury only on the length of the wound it is however entirely probable that even if the wound was 5 inches long it was not deep enough to crack the skull and cause brain injury or if there was such injury it was not so severe as immediately to deprive the deceased of the power of speech in fact primo cupido himself a witness for the defense testified that felipe avendano after he had fallen to the ground yet succeeded in standing up and leaning on the wall of the schoolhouse for about 2 or 3 seconds it is not matter of conjecture that it takes a great deal more of effort to rise from a prone position than to speak at any rate this testimony of carlos avendano that when he rushed to his fathers side after the latter collapsed the latter identified his assailants to him and bade him fetch his mother carlos and lydia avenda who at the trial were 13 and 18 years of age respectively had no reason to perjure themselves no motive has been shown for them to testify falsely against the appellant; in fact the latter admitted that he does not know of any reason why they should accuse him of such a grievous crime moreover the presence of these two witnesses at the time and in the general vicinity of the incident has not been impugned and in fact was even corroborated by the defense witness primo cupido to be sure cupido testified that when he arrived at the spot where felipe avendano fell carlos was not yet there; that when he interrogated the deceased he was already speechless; and that when he asked lydia avendano who attacked her father she allegedly answered that she was not sure in short the defense presented cupido to cast serious doubt on the identification made of the assailants but assuming his declarations to be essentially true still his testimony is not only reconcilable with that of the prosecution witnesses; it is in fact corroborative thereof it will be remembered that carlos at the time of the assault was nearer to his father than cupido thus when carlos went to the side of his father cupido was yet at the dance hall when cupido arrived therefore carlos had already left to fetch his mother at his fathers behest after a short while carlos avendano arrived with his mother verily carlos avendas mother who was admittedly not present at the dance would not have repaired without delay to the scene of the killing had carlos not seen what had earlier happened and had been ordered by his father to fetch his mother the appellant points to allegedly   significant   inconsistencies in lydias testimony to wit  1  whereas in her affidavit executed before the chief of police of lavezares samar she stated that she saw her father hacked twice by pedro alcantara in her direct testimony in open court she stated that her father was slashed first by manuel guinto at the back of the head and then by pedro alcantara; and  2  whereas in the same affidavit she mentioned that while she was crying after her father fell to the floor her brother carlos arrived and also cried on crossexamination she declared that carlos reached their fathers side ahead of her however these inconsistencies or discrepancies are evidently trivial and   may justifiably be overlooked because it is not infrequent that a witness may without design inaccurately narrate certain facts arising from extraordinary occurrences as moore on facts 1098 has said an affidavit being taken ex parte is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate sometimes from partial suggestion and sometimes from want of suggestion and inquiries without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs to the subject  we must consider too the psychological stress which burdened lydia avendano when she appeared and executed the affidavit before the chief of police of lavezares samar only three days after she witnessed the slaying of her father this was a deeply traumatic experience which necessarily affected her equanimity with respect to cupidos averment that when he asked lydia avendano who killed her father she answered that she was not sure the reticence of lydia can be explained by the fact that cupidos cousin donato ligua was a slay victim at the hands of her father for this crime the deceased avendano was not convicted because the case was amicably settled it was reasonable for lydia to have assumed that cupido entertained a grudge against the deceased and his children because of this incident at all events we are convinced after a searching analysis and scrutiny of the testimony of lydia avendano visavis her affidavit that the contradictions in her declarations are trivial which cannot be ascribed to an insidious attempt to distort the truth it is a truism that the most candid witness oftentimes commits mistakes and incurs in inconsistencies in his declarations but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic credibility far from being evidence of falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith and in this case before us a confirmation of the fact that lydia avendano was not a rehearsed witnessthat carlos and lydia avendano were son and daughter respectively of the deceased does not suffice to discredit them on the contrary   their natural interest in securing the conviction of his killers would deter them from implicating persons other than the culprits for otherwise the latter would thereby gain immunity  indeed we note that carlos and lydia appear to be persons who bore absolutely no illfeeling toward the accused; the record does not disclose any untoward motive which could have induced them to perjure themselves in a prosecution for a heinous crime the accused himself admits this absence of motive on the part of the witnesses it has been correctly held that when there is no showing of improper motive on the part of witnesses for testifying against the accused the fact that they are related to the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of full faith and credit further the appellant argues that since the evidence shows that the wound allegedly inflicted by him was merely superficial and would ordinarily have healed in seven days and that the prosecution presented nothing to prove the existence of conspiracy among pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa the liability of each of the accused is therefore merely individual and thus he should be convicted only of slight physical injuries it must be stated that the information charged pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa with   conspiring confederating together and mutually helping one another   in assaulting and stabbing to death felipe avendano article 8 of the revised penal code provides that conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it the agreement of which the law speaks is not limited to one which is written or otherwise expressly or directly made prior to the commission of the crimeit is not necessary that the malefactors for an appreciable time prior to the commission of the crime had actually come together and agreed in express terms to pursue a common designfor conspiracy to exist it is enough that at the time the offense was committed the participants had the same purpose and were united in its execution as may be inferred from the attendant circumstances to establish conspiracy it is not necessary to prove previous agreement to commit a crime if there be proof that the malefactors have acted in concert and in pursuance of the objective this court has repeatedly ruled that conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such point to a joint purpose and design their actions must be judged not by what they say for what men do is the best index of their intention thus this court has ruled in a similar milieu although there is no direct proof of conspiracy between the appellants the simultaneous presence of both at the scene of the crime the shot fired by appellant timoteo cruz immediately after valencia had been shot by felipe de la cruz and the circumstance that forthwith thereafter the latter boarded the formers car which was there ready for the getaway leave no room for doubt as to the existence of unity of action and purpose between them  people v cruz et al l15369 april 26 1962  while conspiracy to commit a crime must be established by positive evidence direct proof is not essential since by its nature it is planned in utmost secrecy consequently competent and convincing circumstantial evidence will suffice to establish it in this case before us although there is no direct evidence on the existence of conspiracy among pedro alcantara manuel guinto and enrique cagsawa still the evidence unmistakably points to the fact that the three were at the japanese bamboo grove; that they stabbed the deceased in rapid succession cagsawa being unable to deliver his intended blow only because lydia the daughter of the deceased shouted   enough   ; and that when lydia thus shouted they all fled together the foregoing convincingly demonstrates that the three accused acted in concert and in pursuance of the same objective joint purpose and design that is to kill the deceased and since in a conspiracy the act of the conspirators becomes the act of all responsibility for the act will be borne equally by all regardless of the degree of their respective participation in the execution of the act once an express or implied conspiracy is proved all of the conspirators are liable as coprincipals regardless of the extent and character of their respective active participation in the commission of the crime or crimes perpetrated in furtherance of the conspiracy because in contemplation of law the act of one is the act of all the foregoing rule is anchored on the sound principle that   when two or more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object whether through the physical volition of one or all proceeding severally or collectively each individual whose evil will actively contributes to the wrongdoing is in law responsible for the whole the same as though performed by himself alone   thus although it is axiomatic that no one is liable for acts other than his own   when two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime each is responsible for all the acts of the others done in furtherance of the agreement or conspiracy   3 the appellants main defense in exculpation is alibi it must be stressed at the outset that alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by an accused especially if there is direct testimony of an eyewitness duly corroborated by that of another not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because of the ease of fabricating evidence of alibi and the difficulty of checking or rebutting it thus we held in people v estrada that    no jurisprudence in criminal cases is more settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and that the same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime such should be the rule for as a defense alibi is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove and for alibi to prosper it is not enough to prove that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed but he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time   and in cases of positive identification of the culprit by reliable witnesses the defense of alibi must be established by   full clear and satisfactory evidence   or by evidence which reasonably satisfies the court of the truth of such defense we address ourselves therefore to the question of whether alcantara has established his defense of alibi by   full clear and satisfactory evidence   the defense of alibi is basically an attempt to show that the defendant was at some other place when the crime was committed for such length of time that it was impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed either before or after the time he was at such other place; or that the distance is such as to preclude the possibility and probability for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed; or that it would have been physically impossible for the accused by reason of illness or impaired physical condition to be at the place where the crime was committed thus the following major factors are to be considered in weighing the merits and demerits of an alibi distance the time and available means of travel the physical fitness of the accused for travel and the ability of the accused to finance a trip to the scene of the crime according to the appellant on june 26 and 27 1963 he was in sitio payang barrio enriqueta lavezares gathering coconuts as he and a companion ignacio gabion were then making copra he climbed 20 coconut trees on the first day and 30 coconut trees on the next before he fell from a height of about four meters he averred that he had been suffering from lumbar rheumatism for a considerable time and that dr leovigildo mijares had been treating him although he hastened to add that he had become well one year prior to june 1963 it is doubtful that one who has been suffering from this ailment for an appreciable period of time can climb 20 coconut trees on one day and then climb another 30 coconut trees on the next especially in the face of the categorical assertion of dr mijares that lumbar rheumatism recurs and cannot be completely cured thus that he did actually climb 50 coconut trees in two days as he claimed is placed in serious doubt more than this it is quite strange that although he stated that after he fell face down from the coconut tree he had to be carried up to his house by ignacio gabion because he could not walk and had to be loaded in a bus bound for catarman by his sister bonifacia alcantara  apparently in an attempt to show that he was in great pain  he did not seek immediate admission to the hospital he entered the hospital only on the third day after he arrived in catarman that is on june 30 the day after the deceased was killed moreover his testimony that he fell from a coconut tree loses its credibility in the face of the contradicting testimony of his own witness dr mijares to the effect that it was only when he entered the hospital on june 30 that he revealed his having fallen from a coconut tree is it not strange if it was really true that he fell from a coconut tree that he should fail to inform his doctor thereof on the very first day that the latter visited and treated him then again he testified that on june 28 he was treated for pains in the chest and in the right and left hips and that when he was asked on june 29 by dr mijares about the said pains he answered that his chest and hips were still painful dr mijares however testified that on those days he merely complained of severe lumbar pains  not chest pains or pains in the right and left hips  and informed the former that he could not walk in fact the medical certificate  exh 2  issued by dr mijares merely certifies to his being    examined  for lumbar rheumatism last june 28 and june 29/63   it was only when he was already in the hospital that he complained to dr mijares about chest pains although significantly fluoroscopy did not reveal any fracture thus the medical certificate  exh 3  states that he was confined at the northern samar general hospital   from june 30 to july 3 1963 for sprain chest   moreover whether he was in such a serious condition that he could not walk is disputable because dr mijares testified that the appellants complaints were subjective symptoms that he  the doctor  could not really be sure that the appellant was in a serious condition but was merely informed by the latter that he could not walk in mijares own words as to his complaint that he was having lumbar pains the appellant   could still move and walk around   but mijares merely advised him to have complete rest in short the doctor without further bother took the appellants word at its face value that he was suffering from lumbar rheumatism was in serious condition and could not walk the integrated testimony of dr mijares should be accorded full credit not because it incidentally served to point up the essential falsity of the testimony of the appellant but principally because although he was the appellants own witness he turned out to be impartial intent solely as we see it on correctly apprising the trial court of the true occurrences and events in which he became directly involved against the backdrop of the foregoing inconsistencies in the testimony of the appellant and his witnesses it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the appellant went through all the trouble of going to catarman and being treated for alleged lumbar rheumatism on june 28 and 29 at the house of his sister by dr mijares and of being hospitalized for alleged chest sprain from june 30 to july 3 at the northern samar general hospital to conceal his participation in the slaying of felipe avendano in fine he was laying down the groundwork of his defense of alibi finally his defense of alibi must be rejected because of the possibility of easy access from catarman to lavezares although the evidence shows that the first trip by bus from catarman to allen which passes barrio enriqueta leaves catarman at 400 am the next at about 800 am and the last between 100 and 200 pm and that the distance between catarman and barrio enriqueta is about 32 kilometers negotiable in 3 to 4 hours still this does not discount the possibility that the accused could have rented a motor vehicle and left for barrio enriqueta after 800 pm on june 29 1963 after dr mijares had paid him a visit and given him tablets to take  he admits that dr mijares visited him at around 600 pm on june 29 and stayed for only a short time  arrived in barrio enriqueta a little past 1000 pm committed the crime charged and returned to catarman all told the evidence is not full not clear and not satisfactory that he was physically unfit for travel and that he could not afford to finance a trip to the scene of the crime being the owner of a coconut plantation thus contrary to the appellants allegations it was not physically impossible for him to have participated in the commission of the offense charged as to the possible motive of the appellant in killing the deceased or in participating therein the evidence reveals that two days before the killing the deceased came upon cagsawa gathering coconuts from his  the deceaseds  plantation and effectively prevented him from doing so this prompted cagsawa to challenge the deceased to a fight but the latter ran away the appellant is the first cousin of his coaccused enrique cagsawa the latters father and the appellants mother being brother and sister it is not therefore farfetched that the appellants involvement in the killing on the night of june 29 was in all likelihood an aftermath of the heated incident that transpired two days before at all events   the defense of alibi is an issue of fact that hinges on credibility; the credibility of an alibi depends so much on the credibility of the witnesses who seek to establish it; and in this respect the relative weight which the trial judge assigns to the testimony of said witnesses must unless patently and clearly inconsistent with the evidence on record be accepted for as is well recognized his proximate contact with those who take the witness chair places him compared to appellate justices in the more competent position to discriminate between the true and the false   people v estrada l26103 jan 17 1968 22 scra 111 citing people v constante l14639 dec 28 1964; and people v berdida et al l20183 june 30 1966  the conclusions of fact reached by a trial judge should be accorded great weight because he is in a better position than the appellate court to observe the behavior of the witnesses and evaluate their credibility

not involved gabato is not around   mario abendan then pointed his gun at rizalde and asked him about the whereabouts of alberto and when rizalde was unable to answer the accused told him   ah you are a cousin of gabato   and thereupon shot rizalde obsiquias three  3  times hitting the latter in the left jaw and right side of the forehead causing his instantaneous death after the shooting accused

prosecution was dr nestor sator the medicolegal officer of the pnp crime laboratory for region 7 he testified that when he examined the slain victim the day after the shooting incident it was already

incurred amounted to fifty thousand  p5000000  pesoshe also stated for the record that the victim rizalde was the seventh of his nine children the accused was wellknown to him as they had been neighbors for seven  7  years the evidence for the defense of accused abendan consisted mainly of his own testimony and that of a neighbor letecia amancia the trial court summarized the facts as follows x x x accused mario abendan 30 years old a rattan worker and a resident of candulawan talisay cebu testified that he transferred to sitio calachuchi consolacion cebu sometime in august 1993 on

the suspect although he was surprised by what he heard it did not occur to him to surrender to the local police to clear his name for fear of his life as he was allegedly being hunted by the vigilantes or   tadtad   but he intended to give up to the authorities in manila accused maintained that the vigilantes were after him because he was a witness to the shooting of his uncle santos llamedos and the latters son ricardo sometime in january 1987 by gualberto gabato a vigilante who suspected the victims as members of the new peoples army  npa  because of the threats on his life he fled to manila and came back to cebu in 1993 or five  5  years after and he was surprised to learn about various killings which happened in talisay cebu wherein he was tagged as a suspect in june of that same year he wrote to president ramos to explain his side about those killings which were attributed to him the office of the presidential consultant for legal affairs responded but he was not able to get hold of the latter because he no longer returned to his previous address as he was already being hunted he did not deny that he knows the obsiquias but belied the testimonies of the

death of rizalde obsiquias the latter merely told her that he was already used to such news and although she knew the police were looking for mario abendan she did not bother to tell the police his whereabouts because she did not want to get involved but she advised abendan to go to the police to clear his nameupon questioning by the judge himself letecia amancia averred that she was certain of the accuseds innocence since they were together on the night and at the time the shooting incident occurred and yet she did not feel compelled to go to the police to inform them of such fact even though she had heard from radio news reports that the accused was the person tagged as the assailant she never even bothered to inform any person in authority that she knew of the accuseds whereabouts

yes sirin the face of the prosecution witnesses categorical and consistent positive identification of the accusedappellant there being no showing of illmotive on their part the accusedappellants defense of alibi is worthlessconsequently the trial court did not err in finding him guilty of the crime charged the aforequoted testimonies of the prosecution witnesses also support the court a quos conclusion that the killing of rizalde obsiquias was attended by treachery while at the outset he was not the intended victim of the accusedappellant the fatal attack on him was so swift and unexpected and without the slightest provocation on his part which are the very earmarks of treacherythe accusedappellant barged into the victims home looking for someone he had the time and opportunity to reflect on his actions upon realizing that his intended victim was not in the premises and yet despite the victims pleas he went ahead and shot the victim delivering not only one but two fatal shots the records show that one shot was fired while the victim had his back turned to the accusedappellant as testified to by the medicolegal expert fiscal alburo q dr with respect to the first gunshot wound what is the trajectory of the bullet a in relation to gunshot wound which point of entry is located at the right cheek the direction of the bullet was going posteriorwards going to the back and making the point of exit here from the right cheek exiting here at the back  witness pointing to the upper part of the back of his head  q how about the other gunshot wound a in relation to gunshot wound no 2 the point of entry is located at the neck right side posterior lateral aspect  witness pointing at the back of his neck  and it is directed upwards and to the left going to the left face and the slug was recovered here  witness pointing to the left cheek near the ear  fiscal alburo q with respect to the first gunshot wound could you determine dr what was the position of the victim when he was shot by the assailant a with respect to the gunshot wound no 1 the relative position of the victim is fronting the assailant while in gunshot wound no 2 the relative position of the assailant is probably more at the back of the victim q do you know dr what was the distance between the deceased victim and the assailant when he shot the victim a considering that there are tattooing at the gunshot wound or point of entry the distance between the muzzle of the gun from the victim is within 2 feeteven if the victim sensed that his life was in danger that did not diminish the suddenness of the attack of the accusedappellant for treachery may still be appreciated even though the victim is forewarned of danger to his personcoupled with the victims obvious helplessness such that he never had the slightest opportunity to defend himself the accusedappellants unprovoked killing of the victim cannot but lead to the conclusion that there was treachery there is no question that the accusedappellants conscious intention was to kill not merely to maim or injure judging from the manner that he executed the act aiming at pointblank range at the victims head and neck only a killer without compunction could deliver such deadly shots at such a defenseless and innocent victim  
homicide, during the trial the prosecution and the defense agreed to adopt the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses estelita latoja and dr cristina preyra given during the separate trial of silva and gulane subject to additional questions on direct examination and full crossexaminationbased on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses the trial court culled the following facts   on december 21 1995 at about 500 oclock in the morning near the immaculate memorial park in bagong silang navotas metro manila estelita latoja gave her son leo who was already on board a tricycle on his way to work transportation money having done so estelita took about two steps on her way back home it did not take long when she heard a gunshot estelita who was then only about a meter away from leo saw silva who was with two other companions named araneta and gulane holding a gun still directed at leo estelita shouted to silva   huwag huwag anak ko iyan   leo on the other hand said to silva   huwag hindi tayo magkatalo   leos wife shirley who was present at that time was not able to say or do anything estelita approached silva who hit her at the left side of the head as he pushed her aside and thereafter fired his gun to  sic  leo estelita added that gulane was also armed with a gun and that he fired about four shots at leo who was hit thereby araneta also fired his gun at leo thereafter the three fled  the accusedappellants claim that estelita was not a credible witness and that her testimony suffers from incredibility deserves scant consideration we have carefully gone over the records and find nothing in her account of the events that would show that her testimony was not credible on the contrary estelita made a clear narration of the shooting of her son in her testimony according to estelita at around 500 am of december 21 1995 a coworker of her son leo latoja  leo  went to their house to ask for transportation money for leo who left their house earlier that morning leo could not ask for the money himself since he was avoiding his oneyearold child who would always insist on going with him leos wife shirley then proceeded to leo who was waiting inside a tricycle parked some two hundred  200  meters away from their house shirley however failed to give leo the money since she forgot her purse leo instead asked estelita who happened to follow shirley to the place where leo was for the money after giving leo some money estelita turned her back from leo and had proceeded to take two  2  steps away from him when she suddenly heard a gunshot she turned her head and saw silva accompanied by two armed men whom she later identified as gulane and the accusedappellant poking a gun at her son upon seeing this she yelled at silva   wag wag anak ko yan   while leo beged   wag di tayo talo   thereafter estelita approached silva in order to defend her son but the latter hit her on the head and pushed her aside silva gulane and the accusedappellant continued to shoot leo who was now sprawled on the pavement oozing with blood then the three fled the scene using a small alleydr rosaline cosidon who performed the autopsy on the body of the victim testified that the victim died of multiple gunshot woundsestelita positively identified the accusedappellant and pointed to him as one of her sons assailants as follows   fiscal acu madam witness in your testimony before this court during the trial of accused gerry silva you testified that on december 21 1995 at 500 oclock in the morning near the immaculate memorial park located at bagong silang navotas metro manila you saw not only gerry silva but also alex gulane and gilbert araneta shot to death your son repeatedly and i am referring to your son leo latoja now the question is if you see gilbert araneta again will you be able to identify him a yes sir i know him q will you please look around this courtroom and point out to us gilbert araneta if you see him inside interpreter  witness pointing to a person who was asked to stand up and when asked his name he answered robert araneta  fiscal acu why are you sure that it was this person gilbert araneta who announced his name as not gilbert but robert araneta as one of the companions of gerry silva in shooting to death your son leo latoja a i have known him for a long time q and how long have you known you said you have known robert aka gilbert araneta for a long time can you give us a number of years how many a five years fiscal acu thats all with the witness  the accusedappellants claim that estelita was mistaken in naming him as   gilbert araneta   and not   robert araneta   does not destroy her credibility and is not sufficient to exculpate him for even assuming that the accusedappellants real name is robert it is sufficient that she was positive as to his physical identity as a participant in the shooting of her son from her own personal knowledge for purposes of identifying him in the present casefurthermore this court has ruled on countless occasions that the trial court is in the best position to determine facts and to assess the credibility of witnesses as it is in a unique position to observe the witnesses deportment while testifying which opportunity the appellate court is denied on appeal; this court will respect the findings and conclusions of the trial court provided that they are supported by substantial evidence on recordin the case at bar we find no cogent reason to disturb the trial courts appreciation of the evidence and find no basis therein to rule that estelitas testimony was not credible besides the appellant has failed to prove any improper motive on the part of estelita to falsely impute such a terrible crime to herein accusedappellant the testimony of a single witness when credible and trustworthy is sufficient to convict and must be given ful  faith and credence when no reason to falsely testify is showngiven the positive identification made by the lone prosecution witness the accusedappellants uncorroborated defense of denial and alibi must fail the defense of alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to contrive and difficult to provea positive identification of the accused made by an eyewitness prevails over such a defenselikewise the denial of accusedappellant cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the prosecution witnesses that he participated in the commission of the crime like the defense of alibi a denial is inherently weak and crumbles in the light of positive declarations of truthful witnesses who testified on affirmative matters that the accusedappellant was at the scene of the incident and was one of the victims assailants and perpetrator of the crimewe now come to the imposition of the proper penalty considering that the participation of the accusedappellant in the killing of leo latoja has been proven beyond reasonable doubt and considering further that the convictions of his coaccused silva and gulane have been sustained by this court in people vs silvawe adopt the finding in said case that homicide was committed as well as the imposition of penalty therein the courts ratiocination regarding the absence of treachery and evident premeditation is in point as follows   the trial court reasoned that the killing was attended by treachery because the suddenness of the attack caught leo offguard thus preventing him from putting up any defense we ruled in a litany of cases that treachery cannot be presumed; it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself the same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before treachery may be considered either as an aggravating or qualifying circumstance further treachery must be based on some positive conclusive proof and not only upon hypothetical facts or on mere suppositions or presumptions the trial court erred when it presumed that the killing was qualified by treachery although the record shows that the witness did not see the commencement of the assault estelita testified that she noticed accusedappellants only after she heard the first shot  q madam witness you mentioned that your son immediately before the shooting incident was with his wife a yes sir q and while your son was with his wife in the tricycle or pedicab do you know where the accused then a no sir q in what stage of the incident when you first noticed silva a upon hearing the first shot q what about gulane a i saw them together q how about gilbert a the three were together q so in other words you first noticed them when you heard the first shot a yes sir q and do i get it right from you that you have not seen them prior to the first shot a no sir in her earlier testimony estelita explained that it was the first shot that prompted her to turn her head and it was only then that she saw gerry silva pointing his gun at her son who was already bloodied these statements are fraught with possibilities nagging doubts would crop up as to how the three  3  assailants started the assault considering that there was an interval of time from the moment estelitas back was towards leo until she heard the first shot before that she did not notice the presence of accusedappellants one can argue that between the time when estelitas back was turned from the victim after she had taken about two  2  steps away and the first shot there was a lapse of more or less four  4  seconds no other logical conclusion then could be drawn but that the attack was sudden and unexpected but this is not that simple where all indicia tend to support the conclusion that the attack was sudden and unexpected but there are no precise data on this point treachery cannot be taken into account it can in no way be established from mere suppositions drawn from the circumstances prior to the moment of the aggression that the accused perpetrated the killing with treachery

murder,that on or about december 24 1981 in the city of manila philippines the said accused conspiring and confederating together with one whose true name identity and whereabouts are still unknown and mutually helping one another did then and there wilfully unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill and with treachery and evident premeditation attack assault and use personal violence upon the person of one edwin tizon y tuico by then and there shooting him with a firearm hitting him on the head thereby inflicting upon the said edwin tizon y tuico a mortal wound which was the direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter contrary to law the facts edwin tizon was formerly employed with the paros disco house in sta mesa manila as a security guard in 1978 tizon resigned and joined the philippine constabulary in the early morning of december 24 1981 tizon decided to visit the paros disco house and join his former coemployees in celebrating christmas he thought that the staff would be holding their christmas party that day on said date and time appellant ricardo benitez y cabreros a soldier of the philippine marines detailed at the malacang compound manila together with his companion also a marine soldier went to paros disco between 200 am and 230 am a commotion erupted when appellant and his friend left the disco without paying their bill eutiquiano apan the discos timekeeper and the victim edwin tizon were then standing outside by the door of the disco when they saw appellant and his companion get into a taxi without settling their account apan pursued them seated inside the taxi appellant adamantly refused to pay and started cursing apan when apan insisted on collecting the bill appellant shoved a 45 cal gun to his face the barrel of a gun did not daunt apan seeing that apan would not let them go appellant grudgingly settled his account with the disco however even after paying appellant still raged against apan at this stage the victim tizon intervened and introduced himself as a military man he assured apan he would take care of the situation appellant then demanded for tizons id instead tizon asked appellant to show his id first the demand angered appellant a heated altercation flared up between tizon and appellant for the latter stubbornly refused to show his id appellant and his companion then dragged tizon by the hand and led him towards the sta mesa bridge after about fifteen  15  meters the three stopped at the foot of the bridge near a meralco lamp post apan saw tizon raise his arms in surrender appellant pushed tizon pulled a gun from his waist and shot him appellant and his companion then fled and headed towards hipodromo street tizon fell by the lamp post of the sta mesa bridge and was brought to the uerm hospital by pepito yatco supervisor of the disco he was pronounced dead on arrival another crime statistic the shooting incident was also witnessed by two  2  other disco employees namely chief comptroller ronillo melgar and floor manager josephine vitualla they were outside the disco about 1517 meters away from the scene of the crime they gave their written statements to the police investigators immediately after the incident they narrated substantially the same facts as testified to by apan appellant interposed alibi as a defense he claimed he could not have committed the crime on said date and time for he was on duty as a guard at the madrigal gate 1 of the malacang compound appellant alleged that his tour of duty commenced at 1200 midnight of december 24 1981 and ended four  4  hours later or at 400 am of the same day appellant testified that during his fourhour duty he never left his post in support of his claim he presented the gate 1 logbook  exh 5  showing that he assumed guard duty at 1200 midnight of december 24 1981 the logbook also showed that he was relieved by sgt pablito gatdula at exactly 400 am of december 24 1981 the logbook also contained several entries made by appellant during his tour of duty viz 0150 h  sg  conducted inspection to  sic  marine guard 0200 h 1lt ancheta j aboard madrigal compound 0215 h capt casipit f passed by madrigal gate and his driver 0300 h no incident happened during my tour of duty 0400 h properly held by the relieving guard and turn over to him all guard properties at the end of his duty appellant said he proceeded to their barracks within the malacang compound he further alleged that they were on red alert from december 16 1981 to january 6 1982 and were not allowed to leave their barracks at any time during said period he testified that it was only on january 25 1982 that he learned he was being implicated in the case at bar he was then at the police precinct 4 substation 4 along hipodromo street assisting his neighbors son arturo guerrero who was being investigated by the police suddenly a tamaraw jeep pulled up at the station with about ten  10  policemen alighting the policemen frisked him and his friend  a pc soldier  and handcuffed them they were brought to police station 4 in balicbalic manila where he was informed that he was a suspect in the killing of edwin tizon at the paros disco he denied knowledge of the crime after a few minutes the police released his soldier friend but detained him appellant further claimed that he does not know prosecution eyewitnesses apan vitualla and melgar he said he saw the three for the first time in court when they testified against him and pointed to him as the gunman appellant insists that from december 16 1981 to january 6 1982 the soldiers stationed in malacang compound had been placed on red alert and were prohibited from leaving their barracks inside the malacang compound he further claims that on the day of the incident between 200 am to 230 am he was stationed at his post in gate 1 of malacang his tour of duty that day started at 1200 midnight and ended at 400 am of the same day during those four  4  hours appellant alleged that he continuously stayed in his post in support of his stance appellant presented the gate 1 security logbook containing the entries he made during his fourhour tour of duty thus appellant maintains that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the crime between 200 am to 230 am at the paros disco house in sta mesa manila the records show that appellant himself admitted that the crime scene was only about a kilometer away from gate 1 of malacang this distance could be traversed in less than four  4  minutes even if one is travelling at a very low speed of 30 kilometers per hour hence although appellant was allegedly at his post in gate 1 from 1200 midnight to 400 am on said date as indicated in the security logbook it was not physically impossible for him to have left his post at any time during this period and proceeded to the paros disco moreover although the gate 1 logbook had an entry allegedly made by appellant that at about 215 am one capt casipit and his driver passed by said gate neither capt casipit nor his driver was presented in court to corroborate appellants logbook entry noticeably the next entry in the logbook allegedly made by appellant at 300 am was a general statement that no incident happened during his tour of duty this entry could have been made by appellant after his involvement in the shooting incident at 230 am and prior to his relief from duty at 400 am more significantly we note that none of the defense witnesses all of whom were soldiers stationed in malacang declared that they saw appellant at his post on that day for the entire time frame of 200 am to shortly before the end of his duty at 400 am in fact marine soldier domingo ledesma admitted that the last time he saw appellant was when the latter reported for duty at gate 1 at 1200 midnight of december 24 1981 and he had no idea what appellant did during his fourhour tour of duty likewise defense witness sgt pablito gatdula testified that he only saw appellant at 400 am that day when he relieved appellant at his post only defense witness sgt cresenciano perio established appellants presence at gate 1 when the former inspected said post at about 150 am however sgt perio stayed only for about three  3  minutes or until about 153 am that still left appellant more than enough time to leave his post and go to paros disco which was only a kilometer away from gate 1 we thus hold that appellants claim he was at his post at the time of the incident is not adequately supported by the defenses documentary and testimonial evidence his defense of alibi must perforce fail especially in the light of the positive identification made not by one but by three credible eyewitnesses to be sure each of the three prosecution eyewitnesses categorically identified appellant as the malefactor and we find no reason to doubt their identification the shooting did not happen at the wink of an eye as to leave these witnesses no time to recognize the appellant it will be recalled that the shooting was preceded by an attention attracting scene created by appellant when he and his soldier companion refused to pay their bill at the paros disco they were insisting that it was one of their privileges as military servicemen at that time apan was with tizon the two were standing by the door of the disco when appellant and his friend left the disco apan ran after them and demanded their payment a shouting match ensued between apan and appellant and the latter at one point drew his gun and shoved it to apans face apan nevertheless stood his ground after a while appellant still furious grudgingly settled his account feeling the tension tizon the victim intervened and introduced himself as a pc soldier appellant and his companion turned their ire on tizon they pulled him aside and walked with him for a few meters towards sta mesa bridge appellant then pulled the trigger on the hapless victim all these transpired in full view of the employees of the disco club who immediately related the shooting to the police investigators the time and spacing of the shooting gave these witnesses ample opportunity to identify appellant it is thus hard to believe that they could have been mistaken in identifying appellant as the malefactor moreover the credibility of these eyewitnesses could not be questioned for there is nothing on the record to suspect that they would perjure themselves prior to the incident appellant was unknown to them the first time they saw appellant was on the day of the shooting 20 so it was for appellant he admitted that the prosecution witnesses were not known to him indeed appellant could not suggest any reason why these strangers would falsely testify against him

identified as appellants ferdinand juan and gil miguel in no time franklin stepped out of the restaurant and followed his companions franklins group had barely left the restaurant when accusedappellants group followed them constantino became apprehensive and suggested to joel that they pass by near the welcome rotonda police detachment the suggestion came too late gil and an unidentified cohort suddenly grabbed franklins arms at that time franklin was about three  3  meters behind his companions constantino tried to help his brother franklin but he was boxed by gil it was ferdinand who drew a knife and stabbed franklin constantino heard his brother scream   may tama ako   he shouted to his wounded brother to seek succor in the nearby united doctors medical center too weak franklin slumped on the ground joel also failed to come to franklins aid as he was startled by the sudden attack he recounted that ferdinand went in front of franklin and stabbed the latter with a fan knife he tried to help the fallen franklin but someone hit him at the back people then started together at the scene and ferdinand gil and their companion fled on board a tricycle with the help of some tricycle drivers franklin was rushed to the hospital the effort was futile he died as a result of   cardiorespiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage secondary to a stab wound in the trunkconstantino remained with his brother at the hospital while joel reported the incident to the police detachment beside the hospital on duty were po3 romeo catolin and defense witness po3 salvador camacho po3 catolin investigated the incident while joel was narrating the incident someone shouted that one of the suspects was at the   palabok king   an eatery adjacent to the police station about seven  7  meters away po3 catolin and joel rushed to the eatery true enough they saw ferdinand sitting on a stool joel immediately pointed to ferdinand as the one who stabbed the victim ferdinand was brought to the police station for investigation curiosity seekers watched as ferdinand was being investigated gil mingled with the crowd outside the detachment he caught the eye of joel who immediately informed the police sensing he had been recognized gil ran joel and po3 catolin chased and nabbed him near the pldt office along espana street gil was also brought to the police station during the investigation ferdinand and gil did not disclose their kinship and pretended they did not know each otherconstantino followed joel at the police station he lost his temper when he saw ferdinand he boxed ferdinand three  3  times until cooler heads pacified him ferdinands nose bled and he was brought to the hospital for treatment franklins death deeply saddened the ballesteros family particularly his mother virginia ballesteros her son just passed the civil engineering licensure examination she was expecting him to help her support his brothers and sisters accusedappellants offered a different version of the incident ferdinand claimed that in the evening of february 21 1991 he went to the house of efren arellano in san andres bukid manila to study he stayed at his friends house until 100 am of february 22 1991 he then proceeded to quiapo and had a snack thereafter he took a jeepney and alighted at the corner of quezon boulevard and e rodriguez avenue quezon city at 340 am upon alighting from the jeepney someone suddenly hit him on the face he suffered a cut above the left eyebrow and felt dizzy he did not recognize his attacker he hurriedly took a tricycle and went home ferdinand was treated by his sister estrellita araza who also advised him to report the incident to the police it was then 400 am ferdinand accompanied by his nephew gil proceeded to the police station when they saw a crowd gathered out side the station they went instead at the nearby   palabok king   where they heard sketchy accounts of the stabbing incident ferdinand told gil to go to the station and find out what happened ferdinand was waiting for gil when joel and po3 catolin arrived at the   palabok king   joel pointed to ferdinand and said   ayan po isa   yan sa sumaksak sinuntok ko po nga iyan   ferdinand recognized joel as the one who boxed him when he alighted from the jeepney forthwith po3 catolin brought ferdinand to the police station for investigation constantino also arrived at the police station upon seeing ferdinand constantino allegedly exclaimed   ikaw pala ang sumaksak sa kapatid ko   thereafter constantino threw a punch at his nose on his part gil averred that while he was snooping around outside the police station he saw joel talking to po3 camacho joel mistook him as one of the assailants saying   isa ka pa   later on joel retracted and po3 camacho allowed him to leave gil did not return to the eatery but headed for home to his surprise joel went after him the police led by po3 catolin also chased him he was collared near the pldt building along espana streetupon his arrest joel accused him as one of the assailants po3 catolin then ordered him to board a ford fiera po3 camacho who was on board the fiera did not bother to inquire why he was arrestedin the precinct he found his uncle ferdinand in police custody p03 salvador camacho testified for the defense he claimed that he and po3 catolin were in front of the detachment when they noticed a man  the victim  slump on the ground joel came and reported the stabbing incident after the investigation po3 camacho and joel tarried outside the detachment gil passed by looking at gil joel said   i think you are one of them   gil denied the accusation joel retracted his accusation thus gil was allowed to leave eyewitnesses joel and constantino positively identified appellants as the malefactors they could not have contrived the actual participation of appellants to the crime in view of the relatively short period of time that elapsed between the stabbing incident and appellants arrest that tragic day neither is their identification of appellants susceptible of doubt they had the opportunity to see appellants at close range on two  2  occasions first when appellants were waiting for the victim outside the restaurant and second when they attacked the victim appellants discredit joel and constantino due to their alleged inconsistent testimonies on how gil boxed the victim joel testified that gil held the right arm of the victim and punched him with his left fistin contrast constantino testified that gil used his right fist in boxing the victimthis inconsistency is trivial it is immaterial whether gil used his left hand or right hand in boxing the victim more important is the certainty of joel and constantino that it was gil who restrained and boxed the victim before ferdinand stabbed him to death appellants assert further that constantino and joel should not be believed because of their relationship with the victim this contention has long been discredited by this court relationship per se of a witness with the victim does not necessarily mean that he biased on the contrary his relationship with the victim would deter him from indiscriminately implicating anybody to the crime his natural interest is to identify and secure the conviction of the real culprit to obtain justice for the death of a relative hence constantinos bloodtie with the victim did not necessarily corrupt the truth of his testimony similarly the fact that joel is a neighbor of the victim cannot diminish the trustworthiness of his testimony geographical accidents do not measure a persons truthfulness the testimony of po3 camacho did not create a dent on the cause of the prosecution the trial court dismissed him as an incredible witness as observed by the trial court the manner that po3 camacho answered the questions propounded on him by defense counsel and the continued use of leading questions by counsel and his materially contradictory statements destroyed his credibility and reveals his lack of knowledge or information on the events of that morning the court appreciates the importance of the testimony of the witness to the cause of the defense however what appeared to the court during the lengthy direct and redirect examination of the witness was an apparent attempt to put words into the witness mouth several times during the taking of witness testimony the court has called the attention of counsel on the manner of questioning the inconsistencies in the testimony when reviewed show that prior statements made on direct testimony were over clarified through the use of suggestive and leading questions

of the prosecutor to   tell the truth  on cross examination appellant admitted he was strict with his children and disciplined them in a military way the following circumstances cited by the trial court led us to conclude that the prosecution proved by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that appellant killed his son thus 1 appellant has the propensity in maltreating his son he himself testified

shouted   dong forgive your father   9 although ermita advised appellant that the victim was slapped and kicked by an unidentified person at the cogon market on april 21 1997 however contrary to a fathers natural reaction appellant failed to take any action to defend a loved one or report the incident to the police; 10 appellant did not return home immediately in fact he was not present during the wake and the burial of his own son conduct so unnatural for a father like him

gamesroderick revealed that they were not in good terms with nardo who had the propensity of picking fistfights whenever he got drunk nardo had punched and kicked roderick more than twenty  20  times prior to november 26 1993 as a result of which the latter bore a grudge against the formerat around 910 oclock of the same evening nardo approached jose and for no apparent reason dragged him away from the premises suspicious that something untoward might happen roderick followed nardo and his uncleupon reaching a vacant lot that was lit by a lamppost roderick saw nardo embraced jose with his left arm then he  nardo  pulled from his waist a butchers knife    colonial    using his right hand the duo grappled for possession of the knife before nardo succeeded in stabbing jose on the chest nardo hurriedly left the crime scene while jose was rushed to the nazareth general hospital where he died soon thereafter roderick proceeded to the house of his aunt and informed her that jose was stabbedmeanwhile police officers cesar calimag mariano dolores jr franklin obispo and donato estayo of the pnp dagupan city received a report over the police radio that a certain nardo espero stabbed jose tababan in perez market perez blvd dagupan city upon arrival at the crime scene they proceeded to the nazareth general hospital in perez boulevard where the victim was brought for medical treatment however they failed to get his statement for the reason that he was already deadin their search for the assailant the police and other concerned citizens spotted nardo espero on the same evening ducking behind the earth dike of a fishpond in mayombo district dagupan city nardo attempted to escape and in the process left his pair of slippers that were partially submerged in the mud the police officers and the concerned citizens chased him until he gave himself up when spo2 calimag fired a warning shot when asked as to the whereabout of the knife that he used in stabbing jose tababan

massive intrathoracic hemorrhage stab wound eustaquio tababan testified that he had adopted and reared the victim jose tababan like his own child in connection with the death of jose tababan eustaquio spent almost p1500000 for the wake and burial expensesfor his defense appellant nardo c espero denied that he stabbed to death jose tababan nardo testified that at around 600 oclock in the evening on november 26 1993 he hit roderick perez on the head inasmuch as the latter threatened to kill him thereafter a fistfight occurred wherein nardo was able to hit roderick twice in the abdomenafter the fistfight nardo went to the fishpond bringing with him a flashlight and a container to catch fish at around 1100 oclock in the evening he was defecating in the fishpond when a person who turned out to be spo2 cesar calimag shot him from the back fearing for his life nardo ran but he was pursued up to his house while inside the house nardo acceded to spo2 calimags invitation for both of them to talk somewhere however he was brought to the dagupan city police station where he was incarcerated for allegedly killing jose tababanappellant contends that the lone prosecution eyewitness roderick tababanperez is biased for the reason that the deceased victim was his uncle and that he had a grudge against the appellant and thus said witness wanted to exact revenge he also contends that roderick gave inconsistent testimonies with regard to the time of their arrival and departure from the wake in the evening of november 26 1993 as well as regards the relative positions of the appellant and the victim while they were moving away from the premises of boy bardon in addition appellant contends that the failure of roderick to stop the alleged aggression by the appellant against his uncle and to extend assistance after the latter was stabbed contradicted common human experience it was established that appellant nardo espero dragged jose tababan from the premises of the late boy bardon to a nearby vacant lot in the evening of november 26 1993 thereafter nardo embraced and subsequently armlocked jose with his left arm before he stabbed the victim with a butchers knife nardo then immediately left the scene of the crime while jose managed to run for a short distance before he fell and succumbed to the single stab wound on his chest the kinship existing between the deceased victim and prosecution witness roderick perez as well as the latters alleged hostile attitude toward the appellant does not militate against the credibility of the said prosecution eyewitness it has been held that revenge is a normal reaction of one betrayed harmed or otherwise of one who has lost a loved one but it does not follow that the desire to avenge such betrayal harm or loss would include implicating even innocent personsin any event the testimony of prosecution eyewitness roderick perez was found by the trial court to be honest and straightforward and therefore worthy of full faith and credence such evaluation by the trial court on the credibility of the prosecution witness carries great weight and is entitled to high respect by this court on appeal considering that the trial court had the opportunity to observe the witness firsthand and to note his demeanor conduct and attitude under grilling examinationmoreover the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of roderick perez are more apparent than real roderick satisfactorily explained during the trial the slightly different answers he gave on direct and on cross examinations relative to the time of their arrival and departure from the wake of boy bardon as mere estimates for the reason that he was not wearing any watch at the time of the stabbing incidentwith respect to the relative positions of the victim and the appellant the solicitor general correctly noted that the duo initially traversed a distance of about twenty  20  meters from the premises of the late boy bardon it was only upon reaching a vacant lot that the appellant embraced and armlocked the victim prior to the attack hence the claim of the appellant that it was impossible for him to embrace and armlock the victim when they were supposed to be walking five  5  meters apart prior to the stabbing incident is misleading it appears clear from the testimony of the prosecutions lone eyewitness that the said acts did not occur simultaneously
